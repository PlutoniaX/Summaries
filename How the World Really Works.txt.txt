Vaclav Smil is a highly accomplished author and scientist. His book, "Numbers Don't Lie," was published in over 20 languages. In this book, he explores the transformative events and advances of the past three generations, including the unprecedented expansion of knowledge and understanding of the physical world and all forms of life. While more people enjoy a higher standard of living and better health than ever before, this is still not the case for the majority of the world's population, which is nearing 8 billion people. Our extensive knowledge has resulted in an array of machines, devices, procedures, protocols, and interventions that sustain modern civilization.

The extent and specialization of human knowledge has advanced significantly over the past few centuries, resulting in highly specialized fields of study and a fragmentation of knowledge. This has made decision-making more difficult, and even experts in one field may struggle to understand research in another. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlighted disagreements among experts, even on seemingly simple decisions like wearing face masks.

The ongoing uncertainties and disputes in the modern world do not excuse the fact that most people have a superficial knowledge of how the world works. This comprehension deficit can be attributed to people constantly interacting with black boxes and the complexities of modern society, which encourage specialization and shallow understanding. Urbanization and mechanization have also contributed to this deficit. While some fields may require specialized knowledge, people should still strive to understand the basics of how things work.

Most modern urbanites are disconnected from the ways we produce our food and build our machines, as the majority of jobs in modern urban areas are in services. Mechanization means that only a small percentage of the global population is engaged in delivering energy and materials for our modern world. As a result, people have a poor understanding of how food and materials are produced, and these processes are seen as outdated and unexciting compared to the world of information.

The text argues that the most talented individuals are not working in fields related to material necessities, but instead are focused on electronic information. Many believe that dematerialization and artificial intelligence will eliminate the need for the Earth's environment and its resources. However, these predictions are premature and based on unrealistic fantasies. Meeting our essential needs will remain a challenge due to growing demand for energy and materials, and the fact that many people still live in conditions lacking modern amenities.

The text argues that human activities have stressed the biosphere to the point of imperiling its long-term functioning. The majority of the world's population, including nearly all people in sub-Saharan Africa, still lack access to sufficient energy to achieve a dignified standard of living, and addressing this demand will inevitably subject the biosphere to further degradation. There is a consensus that action is needed to address climate change, but simply decarbonizing is not a feasible solution given the world's reliance on fossil fuels. Complete decarbonization would require an unthinkable global economic retreat or near-miraculous technical advances, making it an unlikely solution.

The author argues that in order to make rational decisions about our future, we need a better understanding of the fundamental realities governing our survival and prosperity. They aim to provide this understanding by examining seven key topics, including our dependence on fossil fuels and the challenges of decarbonizing the global energy supply. The author does not make predictions about the future or advocate for specific interpretations of reality, but instead aims to help readers better understand the opportunities and limits of our world.

The second and third chapters of the book focus on the challenges of decarbonizing food production and the production of key materials, including ammonia, steel, concrete, and plastics, which are essential for modern civilization. The author explains that these industries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels for energy and raw materials, and that it will be difficult to transition to renewable energy sources without relying on fossil fuels in the short term. The author also argues that claims about the dematerialization of modern economies are misleading, and that material demands continue to rise even in affluent societies.

The text covers several topics. The first chapter discusses how progress has improved the quality of life for many people but not all, particularly those in low-income countries. The fourth chapter explores the history and recent developments of globalization, with uncertain future prospects due to political and economic considerations. The fifth chapter analyzes risk assessment and provides a framework for evaluating common dangers. The sixth chapter discusses how environmental changes, particularly global warming, could impact necessities like oxygen, water, and food.

The text discusses the long history of understanding the fundamentals of global warming and the actual degree of warming associated with doubling atmospheric CO2. Despite this knowledge, humanity has chosen to ignore warnings and facts and become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding the facts of the matter to effectively tackle the problem. The closing chapter explores the opposing propensities of catastrophism and techno-optimism and provides a perspective that does not favor either doctrine, highlighting the complicated trajectory of the future.

The author's book on global challenges and risk probabilities is based on abundant scientific findings and decades of interdisciplinary research. Rather than focusing on drilling deep into one area, the author prefers to scan wide horizons, with a main interest in energy studies. The author's output includes books on energy, growth, risk, and the global environment.

The book is the product of the author's lifelong quest to understand the basic realities of the biosphere, history, and the world we have created. The author advocates for a more measured and necessarily agnostic perspective and provides a foundation for understanding how the world really works. The book contains many numbers and an appendix on understanding numbers, large and small. The first chapter focuses on a closer, quantitative look at energies.

The text presents a hypothetical scenario where a sapient civilization monitors Earth to detect any new kind of energy conversion or physical manifestation dependent on it. In fundamental physical terms, any process can be defined as a sequence of energy conversions, and passing probes would see only monotonous displays of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and atmospheric storms until the emergence of the first simple, single-celled photosynthetic microbes in shallow seas 3.5 billion years ago. The emergence of cyanobacteria marks a fundamental shift as they start using visible incoming solar radiation to convert CO2 and water into oxygen.

The text describes a hypothetical scenario where a sapient civilization monitors Earth using probes to detect any new kind of energy conversion or physical manifestation dependent on it. Probes record the emergence of simple, single-celled photosynthetic microbes, the rise and diffusion of red and brown algae, and the existence of the first organisms made of differentiated cells, known as Ediacaran fauna. They also record the rapid changes in the emergence, diffusion, and extinction of a huge variety of species, starting with the Cambrian explosion, the arrival of the first fishes, amphibians, land plants, and four-legged animals. Periodic extinctions reduce the variety of species, and four-legged animals briefly standing or walking on two legs become the norm with enormous energetic implications.

The evolution of hominins towards planetary dominance is marked by the first use of fire and the deliberate manipulation of the environment for survival. This is followed by the adoption of crop cultivation and the domestication of animals, which provide extrasomatic energy beyond human muscle power. The use of inanimate prime movers like sails comes much later.

Before the industrial revolution, most useful mechanical energy was provided by animate power, while all thermal energy came from the combustion of plant fuels. The use of harnessed animals, wind, and water provided significant amounts of energy, but much of the work was still done by people. The alien probe detects the first use of coal as a heat source in 1600 in England, marking the beginning of the industrial revolution.

By 1800, fossil fuels supplied only a small fraction of the world's heat and energy, with plant fuels and human/animal muscles still dominant. However, England was an early adopter of coal and steam engines, with some mines relying on them by the early 18th century. Even by 1850, rising coal extraction only supplied 7% of fuel energy, with draft animals and human muscles still providing the majority of kinetic energy. The Boulton & Watt company introduced more efficient steam engines in the 1770s, but they were not yet widely adopted.

By 1900, half of the world's primary energy comes from traditional fuels (wood, charcoal, straw) and modern energy sources (coal and some crude oil). Inanimate prime movers, including coal-fired steam engines, water turbines, windmills, and internal combustion engines, supply about half of all mechanical energy. By 1950, fossil fuels provide nearly three-quarters of primary energy and over 80% of mechanical energy. By 2000, biomass fuels only provide about 12% of the world's primary energy, and animate prime movers (human and animal power) only hold a 5% share of mechanical energy. There has been a rapid global substitution of primary energy sources towards fossil fuels and the introduction and growth of new inanimate prime movers over the past two centuries.

The mobilization of fossil fuels led to a significant increase in global primary energy supply over the past 220 years, with a 60-fold increase in the 19th century, a 16-fold gain in the 20th century, and a 1,500-fold increase overall. This has been a major factor in the advances of modern civilization, but concerns remain about the vulnerability of their supply and the environmental impacts of their combustion. However, the energy gain was actually higher than the 1,500-fold increase due to concurrent improvements in conversion efficiencies.

The 20th century saw a 40-fold gain in useful energy, with a 3,500-fold gain since 1800. The global supply of useful energy per capita rose from 0.05 in 1800 to 28 in 2000, and to about 34 in 2020. On average, people nowadays have nearly 700 times more useful energy at their disposal than their ancestors did at the beginning of the 19th century, which has led to significant improvements in human exertion, leisure time, and standard of living. The increase in useful energy underlies all the gains in modern civilization.

The per capita energy use has increased significantly in countries that have undergone rapid modernization since 1950, with the highest increases seen in Japan, South Korea, and China. Energy conversions are fundamental to human societies and economies, and the trajectory of useful energy deployment reveals the transitions to new energy sources that have shaped the modern world. Physicists have recognized the importance of energy in human affairs since the late 19th century, with Ludwig Boltzmann and Erwin Schrdinger emphasizing the role of free energy in sustaining life. Alfred Lotka concluded that organisms that capture the available energy hold an evolutionary advantage, and this insight influenced the study of energy flows in ecosystems.

Energy is the universal currency and the basis of progress and evolution. Ecologist Howard Odum and physicist Robert Ayres have emphasized the central role of energy in all economies. Despite this, modern economics has largely ignored energy and assumes that it can be produced like man-made capital. Economists are not rewarded for being preoccupied with energy, and societies only become concerned about it when its supply is threatened and prices soar. The frequency of the term "energy price" remained negligible until the 1970s, when OPEC's quintupling of crude oil prices caused a sudden spike in its popularity.

The frequency of the term "energy price" has declined significantly since 1972. Energy literacy is important for understanding how the world works. Energy should not be conflated with power. Different forms of energy and energy densities have affected economic development, and the transition to less reliance on fossil fuels will take longer than anticipated. Energy is a fundamental quantity that can be defined as the potential for action, motion, and change. Newton's laws of motion led to the derivation of basic energy units, but this definition only refers to kinetic energy. Our understanding of energy was expanded during the 19th century.

Energy is defined as the capacity for doing work, which involves producing a change of configuration in a system against a resisting force. Richard Feynman identified nine forms of energy, but we still have no knowledge of what energy is at its most basic level. We can use formulas to calculate different forms of energy, but we cannot easily reduce these energies to a single entity in our minds.

Energy is a complex and often misunderstood concept, with various forms that need to be converted for use. Some substitutions of energy forms are easy and beneficial, while others remain expensive or unaffordable. For example, electric cars are more expensive than traditional vehicles, and the production of ammonia for fertilizers depends heavily on natural gas.

Energy conversions are complex and involve various forms of energy, with dissipated low-temperature heat being a result of all conversions. The quality of energy varies, with the energy required for food production being several times higher than the energy content of the edible meat. While different energy qualities can be calculated, there is a fundamental difference between inputs and outputs. There are various choices available for energy conversions, with some being better than others.

The high densities of chemical energy in kerosene and diesel fuel are good for flying and shipping, but nuclear reactors are the best choice for submarines and large nuclear reactors are the most reliable producers of electricity. Many people confuse energy with power, which measures energy per unit of time, and establishments that generate electricity are commonly called power plants. Power equals energy divided by time, and energy equals power multiplied by time. Even engineering publications often misuse the term "power station" when they actually mean installed (rated) power.

A generating station may have installed (rated) power of 1,000 megawatts, but it can produce electricity at that rate, generating 1,000 megawatt-hours or 3.6 trillion joules in an hour. Liquid hydrocarbons refined from crude oil have the highest energy densities of all commonly available fuels and are best for transportation. Energy density and physical properties of fuels are important for transport. For instance, wood would take up 2.5 times the volume of coal, reducing a ship's capacity to transport people and goods. Natural gas-powered flight is impossible due to the low energy density of methane. The shift to green solar electricity is not instant and not the solution for all energy needs.

Crude oil is a preferred liquid fuel due to its high energy density and ease of production, storage, and distribution. It can be refined into different types of fuels and non-fuel products, such as lubricants and asphalt. Its demand is driven by the automotive and industrial sectors, with over 120 megatons used annually globally. Despite the availability of synthetic alternatives, the demand for crude oil products is expected to increase as these industries expand.

Crude oil has many non-fuel uses, such as in the production of synthetic fibers, resins, adhesives, dyes, paints and coatings, detergents, and pesticides. The shift from coal to crude oil as the primary source of energy took generations to accomplish and was driven by the widespread adoption of internal combustion engines. Crude oil became a global fuel and the world's most important source of primary energy due to the discoveries of giant oil fields in the Middle East and the introduction of large tankers.

The text discusses the discovery of large oil reserves such as Ghawar, Safaniya, and Manifa in Saudi Arabia and Romashkino and Samotlor in the Soviet Union after World War II. The 1950s saw a rise in mass-scale car usage and the expansion of foreign trade and travel, leading to a doubling of global oil extraction. Despite increasing demand, oil prices remained low, which resulted in a lack of incentives for efficient use. As a result, inefficient processes were used in energy-intensive industries and homes were built without adequate insulation. American demand for oil rose significantly during the late 1960s, and global demand increased by nearly 50 percent.

The text explains that in the 1950s, oil production doubled, but prices remained low, leading to inefficient use. By 1970, the US's share of global oil production fell, while OPEC's production share rose, giving them more power to raise prices. In 1973, OPEC raised its posted price, and six Arab Gulf states embargoed oil exports to the US, leading to a 4.5-fold increase in the cost of oil in a year, which ended the era of rapid economic expansion. From 1950 to 1973, Western Europe's economic product nearly tripled, and the US GDP more than doubled.

The global economic growth rate dropped by 90% between 1973 and 1975 due to oil price rises, which improved industrial energy efficiency. However, a second wave of oil price rises in 1978 led to another 90% decline in global economic growth until 1982. Oil-saving measures remained in place, intensifying transitions to more efficient industrial uses. Crude oil extraction surpassed the 1979 record in 1995, meeting demand from a reforming China, but oil's share of global primary energy supply fell from 45% in 1970 to 33% in 2019, and its further decline will continue as natural gas consumption and wind and solar electricity generation increase.

Large-scale reliance on intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar for electricity would require mass-scale, long-term electricity storage or extensive grids of high-voltage lines. It's uncertain if these renewables could replace all coal and natural gas generation, and liquid fuels for transport within two to three decades. Unlike solid or liquid fuels, electricity is intangible and requires scientific understanding to harness its potential, making its transition to complete electrification of transport more complex.

Electricity is a powerful force with visible effects such as static electricity and lightning, but its common definitions are not instinctively accessible. Understanding of its internal workings, from generating plants to final-use devices, remains a mystery to most people. While small quantities of electricity can be produced easily, generating it for mass-scale commercial use is a costly and complicated undertaking. Lightning is too powerful and destructive to be tapped for productive use.

Electricity is complex to generate, store, and distribute, but its use provides unequaled advantages such as effortless and clean consumption, high efficiency, and powerful lighting. Despite technical challenges and high costs, the quest for higher electrification will continue.

Electricity conversion has had a significant impact on industrial production and household tasks, with electric motors revolutionizing nearly every sector of industrial production and later penetrating every household niche. The service sector relies heavily on electricity, with electric motors powering various tasks such as elevators, escalators, air conditioning, and garbage compacting. Luminous efficacy has also greatly improved, with modern sodium lamps producing up to 1,000 times more luminous flux per watt compared to candles. Mobile phone vibrators are powered by tiny units activated by electricity.

Electricity dominates both mechanical and household tasks, including supplying heat and refrigeration, powering electronic devices and security systems, and providing energy for water heating. Electric motors power various transportation modes, from high-speed trains to basic car models. Without electricity, drinking water in cities and fuel pumps for gasoline, kerosene, and diesel would be unavailable. The long-term trend towards electrification, including renewable sources, has been unmistakable, but complications and complexities still exist in the electricity generation process.

Electricity accounts for only 18% of global energy consumption. Its commercial generation began in 1882 with coal-fired and hydroelectric stations, and it expanded rapidly with the adoption of AC transmission and motors. In 2020, hydro accounted for 16%, wind and solar 7%, and the rest came from coal and natural gas. Nuclear power peaked in 2006 and now accounts for about 10%. Demand for electricity has been growing faster than for all other forms of energy.

Global electricity generation grew five-fold between 1970 and 2020 while total primary energy demand tripled. The growth of baseload generation increased as more people moved to cities, and the demand for electricity now runs 24/7. A highly reliable electricity supply is essential for modern societies. Disruption of the electricity supply would have catastrophic consequences. Decarbonization is necessary, but the pace and scale of the transition are challenging.



 Fossil fuel reserves in the Earth's crust are not running out anytime soon. 

 There are concerns about global warming and a push to decarbonize the energy supply to limit it to 1.5C or 2C. 

 The goal is net-zero or carbon neutrality, allowing for continued emissions to be offset by CO2 removal or temporary measures. 

 Over 100 nations have set net-zero goals, with China aiming for 2060. 

 Achieving net-zero by 2050 will require an unprecedented energy transition in both pace and scale.



 Renewables can compete with fossil fuels, and some countries have transformed their generation with wind and solar power. 

 Intermittency is not a problem as long as renewables supply small shares of total demand or shortfalls can be made up by imports. 

 Denmark generates 45% of its electricity from wind power and can sustain high shares without large domestic reserves due to imports. 

 Germany, with higher demand, must maintain reserve capacity to activate when new renewables are not generating enough. 

 In 2019, 89% of Germany's fossil-fired capacity was still needed to meet demand on cloudy and calm days.

The growth of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar, faces challenges in transmission and energy storage. While technically mature solutions exist, construction of new transmission lines has fallen behind and large-scale energy storage options are limited. Pumped hydro storage is currently the most viable option for energy storage, but it is limited to areas with suitable elevation differences and consumes a quarter of generated electricity for uphill pumping. Renewed reliance on nuclear electricity generation may also be necessary to address intermittency issues. Other energy storage options have much lower capacities than needed for large cities.

The future of nuclear energy is uncertain in the West due to high costs, construction delays, and anti-nuclear sentiment, but China, India, and South Korea are committed to expanding nuclear capacities. Small, modular, and safe reactors have yet to be commercialized. However, the European Union recognizes that it cannot meet its ambitious decarbonization targets without nuclear energy, with up to 20% of all energy consumption coming from nuclear fission. Decarbonizing long-distance transportation remains a challenge, and expanded electricity generation may be used for heating and some industrial processes.

The energy density of current lithium-ion batteries is significantly lower than that of kerosene burned by turbofans in jetliners. Even if battery energy density triples by 2050, it will still be insufficient to power wide-body planes for intercontinental flights. Furthermore, there are no readily deployable commercial-scale alternatives to energize the production of materials necessary for modern civilization, meaning that decarbonization outside of electricity generation has been slow.

Despite extensive and expensive expansion of renewable energies, the share of fossil fuels in the world's primary energy supply has only marginally fallen from 87% to about 84% due to the economic rise of China and global demand for fossil carbon, which is nearly five times more than the recent annual harvest of all staple grains. High relative share and scale of dependence on fossil carbon make rapid substitutions impossible, and government targets for years ending in zero or five cannot handle this issue. Therefore, a realistic conclusion based on engineering and economic realities is required.

Long-term energy scenarios recognize the gradual decline of fossil fuel usage. The affluent world can quickly decarbonize, but the more than 5 billion people with lower energy consumption will require fossil fuels for essential needs. The transition to renewable energy will be gradual and not sudden. Securing sufficient and nutritional food is vital for every species, and human evolution gave us physical advantages to become farmers.

Early human ancestors evolved physical traits that allowed them to become scavengers, collectors of plants, and hunters of small animals. They used simple stone tools for butchering animals, and most of their meat came from scavenging kills made by wild predators. The invention of long spears, axes, and fishing tools allowed for hunting and catching a wider variety of species. The transition to sedentary living through early agriculture and domestication of animals resulted in a more reliable but often still unpredictable food supply, which could support higher population densities. Coastal groups with access to fish migrations and aquatic mammals had the highest population densities.

Early agriculture allowed for higher population densities, but limited the variety of plants that were cultivated. This led to the need for large amounts of land to feed people. Preindustrial rates of food production were slow to improve, leading to frequent malnutrition and famine. Harvests were often destroyed in wars. Only a small share of well-fed elites did not have to worry about having enough to eat until a few generations ago.

The ability to produce a surplus of food has been essential to human progress, and food shortages have declined significantly in recent decades. The worldwide share of undernourished people has decreased from about 65% in 1950 to 8.9% in 2019, despite a large increase in the global population. This achievement is due to improvements in crop yields through better varieties, mechanization, fertilization, irrigation, and crop protection.

Modern food production relies on both the sun and fossil fuels, with the latter being crucial for machinery, transportation, and inputs like fertilizers and agrochemicals. The intensity of crop and animal production has increased due to anthropogenic energy subsidies, allowing us to supply adequate nutrition to 90% of humanity and reduce global malnutrition. Without fossil fuels and electricity, we could not have achieved this.

Agriculture relies on solar radiation to power photosynthesis and produce plant mass for crops and animal feed. The addition of non-solar energy, particularly in the form of fossil fuels, has impacted crop production and wild marine species capture. This shift began two centuries ago and has allowed for an increase in crop yields and a decrease in the area of cropland needed to feed one person. The article traces the evolution of this shift in American wheat production in the past two centuries.

The text describes the laborious and low-yielding farming practices of early settlers in British North America, which involved the use of solar energy and no non-renewable energy inputs or fossil fuels. The sequence includes plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, and winnowing by hand, and the production of food, animal feed, and wood for fuel and other uses. The farming required about 150 hours of human labor and 70 ox-hours per hectare, and yielded just one ton of grain per hectare. Nonetheless, the use of renewable resources made it a sustainable and self-sufficient system.

The text describes the shift in wheat farming practices from the use of solar energy and human/animal labor to the use of fossil fuels and machines in the Great Plains of North Dakota in 1901. The new hybrid farming involved highly mechanized processes, including the use of gang plows, mechanical seed drills, and harvesters, reducing the time and human labor required to produce one kilogram of grain. However, it also required a large investment in draft animals and fodder production to supplement their energy needs. Coal was used to power the machines and produce metallurgical coke, contributing non-renewable energy inputs to the farming system.

The conversion of cast iron to steel in open hearth furnaces is essential for manufacturing agricultural machinery, steam engines, rails, wagons, locomotives, and ships, all of which rely on coal for power. Inorganic fertilizers are being used, and farms in wheat country have increased in size, with field work dominated by powerful tractors and large machinery. Modern farming techniques involve the use of certified seed growers, inorganic fertilizers, and targeted protection against pests and weeds. Harvesting is done by large combines that transfer grain directly to trucks for transport and storage. The production of wheat now requires less than two hours of human labor per hectare, resulting in high yields and efficient production.

Over the past two centuries, the labor required to produce a kilogram of American wheat has decreased from 10 minutes to less than two seconds. The use of inexpensive steel plows and inorganic fertilizers has been critical to this transformation, as well as the infusion of fossil energies as machine fuels and raw materials. Photosynthesis remains an essential source of energy for agriculture, but without the direct and indirect use of fossil fuels, high yields with minimal labor inputs and low costs would not be possible. This shift in energy use has been necessary for modern industrial and technological advances to take place, as most of the population historically had to remain in rural areas to produce their own food.

Modern farming requires significant amounts of energy to produce and power farm machinery, but the energy requirements of producing agrochemicals, particularly nitrogenous fertilizers, are much higher. Fertilizers require less energy per unit of final product but are needed in large quantities to ensure high crop yields. The synthesis of nitrogenous fertilizers is the most important indirect energy input in modern farming due to its high demand for every living cell.

Nitrogen is abundant in the atmosphere, but it exists as a non-reactive molecule, making it a key limiting factor in crop productivity and human growth. Lightning and bacteria can split the bond between nitrogen atoms and make it available to form reactive compounds. Bacteria associated with the roots of leguminous plants are responsible for most natural nitrogen fixation. Leguminous food crops can provide their own nitrogen supply, but other staple crops cannot, and the only way for them to benefit from nitrogen fixers is to rotate them with legumes.

In traditional agriculture, human and animal wastes were collected and applied to fields as they were the only way to enrich soil nitrogen stores. However, this was laborious and inefficient due to their low nitrogen content and subject to volatilization losses. The task of collecting and applying wastes claimed a significant portion of all labor in cropping. The mining and export of Chilean nitrates in the 19th century and the invention of ammonia synthesis by Fritz Haber in 1909 led to the rapid commercialization of inorganic nitrogenous fertilizer, breaking the nitrogen barrier to higher crop yields.

The widespread application of nitrogenous fertilizers started after World War II, enabling new high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice to express their full yield potential, and allowing the Green Revolution to take place. Synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers have been the primary agricultural energy subsidy since the 1970s. Fossil fuel subsidies are necessary to produce bread, chicken, and tomatoes abundantly, reliably, and affordably, and our food production cannot feed the world without relying on fossil fuels. The energy costs of producing these common foodstuffs are considerable.

Grain cultivation requires relatively little energy compared to other foodstuffs, but still requires a large amount. Efficient American production of rain-fed wheat on the Great Plains requires about 4 megajoules of energy per kilogram of grain, most of which comes from diesel fuel. A kilogram of basic sourdough bread contains about 580 grams of flour, 410 grams of water, and 10 grams of salt, and to get this amount of flour, about 800 grams of whole wheat is needed.

Growing, milling, and baking a 1-kilogram sourdough loaf requires an energy input equivalent of at least 250 milliliters of diesel fuel, and for a standard baguette (250 grams), the embedded energy equivalent is about 2 tablespoons of diesel fuel. The energy cost is even higher when bread is distributed from large bakeries. The energy consumption for a Paleolithic diet composed only of meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit would be much higher than that of a grain-based diet.

The most efficiently produced meat is broiler chicken raised in CAFOs. Chicken has shown impressive gains in feeding efficiency over the past 5 decades with the lowest feed-to-meat ratio at 3:1. Producing one American chicken requires 3 kg of grain corn, with feed costs ranging from 150-750 mL/kg of edible meat. Corn has high yields and low energy costs, but the energy cost of irrigated corn may be twice as high as rain-fed. Large-scale intercontinental trade in feedstuffs has further energy costs, dominated by the shipment of American corn and soybeans and the sale of Brazilian soybeans. Brazilian soybean cultivation requires the equivalent of 100 mL of diesel fuel per kilogram of grain, but trucking adds to the overall energy cost.

Growing broiler chickens to slaughter weight requires energy for housing, heating, water supply, and waste removal, with a wide range of energy volumes produced. The total energy requirement for producing and delivering a kilogram of roasted chicken to dinner plates is at least 300-350 mL of crude oil, which is remarkably efficient compared to the rates for bread. Chicken's comparably affordable prices help explain its dominance in Western countries. The crop's transportation from production areas to ports and shipping to Europe doubles the energy cost.

Tomatoes are a globally popular fruit with high vitamin C content, but they have a surprisingly high energy burden in cultivation and marketing. They are mostly water, with only a small amount of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. While they can be grown anywhere with warm weather, commercial cultivation is highly specialized and mostly limited to a few places such as California in the US and Europe.

Tomatoes are increasingly grown in plastic-covered single- or multi-tunnel enclosures or greenhouses in various countries, including Canada, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, Spain, and Italy. Plastics, which rely on hydrocarbons, are used to construct enclosures, clips, and other devices, as well as for the synthesis of protective compounds. Calculating the energy bill for tomato cultivation is complicated and requires specialized accounting, as it involves both direct and indirect energy inputs.

Greenhouse tomato cultivation is a heavily fertilized and energy-intensive process, with synthetic fertilizers, micronutrients, and pesticides contributing to its high energy costs. Heating is the largest direct use of energy in greenhouse cultivation, and plastic greenhouses in the Almera province of Spain are the world's largest covered area of commercial produce cultivation. A meticulous study found that the cumulative energy demand of net production is more than 500 milliliters of diesel fuel per kilogram for heated multi-tunnel greenhouses and only 150 mL/kg for unheated ones. Despite the high energy costs, these greenhouses produce nearly 3 million tons of early and out-of-season vegetables and some fruit annually.

Tomatoes exported from Almera's heated plastic greenhouses have a high energy cost due to transportation, storage, and packing, with a 13-ton load of tomatoes from Almera to Stockholm consuming about 1,120 liters of diesel fuel. The embedded energy cost of producing and transporting these tomatoes is equivalent to more than five tablespoons of diesel fuel per medium-sized tomato. Marine hunting is widely and intensively practiced by fleets of ships scouring the world's oceans for wild fish and crustaceans, while hunting on land has become a marginal source of nutrition in affluent societies.

Capturing seafood is a highly energy-intensive process, with a mean of 700 mL/kg of fossil fuel needed to catch and harvest wild fish. However, some pelagic species such as sardines can be caught with a much lower energy investment. Aquacultured seafood, such as shrimp, still requires a significant amount of energy due to their need for protein-rich fish meals and fish oil derived from wild catches.

Aquaculture has become a significant source of global food production, but it has intensified the exploitation of smaller herbivorous fish needed to feed expanding aquaculture. The energy costs of growing Mediterranean sea bass in cages are comparable to those of capturing wild species, while only herbivorous fish that can consume plant-based feed have a low energy cost. Our food supply is increasingly dependent on fossil fuels, which is often ignored by those who predict rapid decarbonization. The scale of dependence on fuel and food is too large for easy or rapid change.

The growth of food production has become overwhelmingly dependent on modern fossil energy inputs, with energy subsidies in agriculture increasing 90-fold from 1900 to 2000. These subsidies target the components of the food system where the greatest returns can be expected. Despite this dependence, anthropogenic energy inputs into modern field farming, fisheries, and aquaculture only account for about 4% of recent annual global energy use. However, this small input has disproportionately large consequences and is necessary to reduce or remove natural constraints in food production.

Direct energy use in food production in the US is around 1% of the national supply, but when the energy requirements of food processing, marketing, packaging, transportation, and storage are added, it reaches nearly 20%. These rising energy needs are driven by factors such as consolidation of production, food import dependency, and the increasing consumption of prepared and convenience foods. Modern food production practices have many undesirable environmental impacts, and many changes are desirable, but it is unclear how fast and to what extent they can happen. The challenge is to feed a world of soon-to-be 8 billion people without synthetic fertilizers and other agrochemicals.

The article discusses the challenges of purely organic farming, which requires the use of draft animals and manual labor, and the abandonment of cities for village life. It also highlights that even if people were willing to make this lifestyle change, organic farming would only be able to sustain less than half of today's global population, due to the reduced labor force and economic transformations that would need to occur. The decline of human labor in American wheat production since 1800 is used as an example of the impact of mechanization and agrochemicals on agriculture.

Using old farming methods with draft animals and organic fertilizers would not be sufficient to meet the food demands of today's population. In the past, a quarter of US farmland was used to feed working horses and mules, which was enough to feed the smaller population. However, it would not be feasible to use just 25 million horses to feed over 330 million people. Organic fertilizers have low nitrogen content and large amounts of organic matter would need to be used to produce high crop yields, which would not be practical to implement on a large scale. Synthetic fertilizers have enabled modern agriculture to achieve high crop yields, and it would be challenging to produce enough food without them.

Synthetic fertilizers are much more nitrogen-dense than recyclable waste, meaning farmers would have to apply 10-40 times as much manure to achieve the same results. Organic matter also loses significant nitrogen compounds, making it less effective. Handling and applying synthetic fertilizer is easier and requires less labor. The total mass of recyclable materials is too small to meet today's nitrogen demands, and six major flows bring nitrogen to croplands: atmospheric deposition, irrigation water, crop residues, animal manures, leguminous crops, and synthetic fertilizers.

Synthetic fertilizers supply over half of the total 210-220 megatons of nitrogen used in agriculture, enabling current levels of food production for almost 8 billion people. Recycling manure as a replacement for synthetic fertilizers is limited due to constraints such as heavy metals, drug residues, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Grazing animals produce a large amount of nitrogen, but gathering their waste is impractical due to accessibility limitations.

Expanding the cultivation of leguminous crops to increase nitrogen supply is an option but would come at a considerable opportunity cost as it would reduce the ability to use fields to produce two crops in a year, lower overall food energy yields, and reduce food-producing capacity in regions with double-cropping. Additionally, the nitrogen content of animal wastes is too low, and its transportation to treatment points and then to crop fields is prohibitively costly.

China's intensive double-cropping requires record-level nitrogen applications and synthetic fertilizers, which are necessary to feed the country's population of 1.4 billion people on mixed diets. Traditional Chinese farming could only supply overwhelmingly vegetarian diets for 10-11 people per hectare, but the most productive double-cropping can produce enough to feed 20-22 people whose diets contain about 40% animal and 60% plant protein. A global population of 8 billion people on mixed diets cannot be supported solely by the laborious recycling of organic wastes and by more common rotations. Reducing food waste could help reduce energy subsidies in crop and animal production.

Global food losses are excessive due to a difference between output and actual needs, with at least one-third of the overall food supply wasted. Root crops, fruits, and vegetables are lost by almost half, while fish and cereals by about a third. Food waste reduction is challenging due to the long and complex production-processing-distribution-wholesaling-retailing-consumption chain. In low-income countries, higher food prices are not a desirable way to fix the problem of food waste, as food access for many disadvantaged families remains precarious.

Reducing agriculture's dependence on fossil fuel subsidies in affluent nations can be achieved by adopting healthier and more sustainable diets such as moderate meat consumption and favoring meat grown with lower environmental impact. Mass-scale veganism is unlikely to succeed as meat-eating has been a significant part of human evolutionary heritage, and sufficient animal protein is necessary for human growth. However, affluent nations can reduce their meat consumption significantly without adopting veganism or vegetarianism.

The best nutritional advice is to not eat more than an adult's body mass equivalent in meat per year to obtain adequate protein. High-level carnivory has no proven nutritional benefits and contributes to environmental stress. Meat consumption in Japan and France is low, and if high-income countries follow suit, they could reduce crop harvests. However, meat consumption is rising in modernizing nations, and some people in Asia and Africa would benefit from more meat in their diets. Improving the efficiency of nitrogen uptake by plants could reduce the dependence on synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.

The share of applied nitrogen incorporated by crops has declined and leveled off, with a substantial amount lost to the atmosphere and water. There is no near-term prospect for reducing the global dependence on synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers, as more people will need access to food. Decarbonized field machinery and alternatives to natural gas-based synthesis of ammonia are possible solutions, but they require substantial investments and advances in renewable electricity generation and large-scale storage. Developing grain or oil crops with nitrogen-fixing abilities would be a nearly perfect solution, but no commercial varieties have been released yet.

The world's food system is heavily reliant on fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources. Despite the recognition of the problem, it is unlikely that all countries will adopt large-scale reductions in their typical diets. The modern agricultural practices depend on better varieties of crops and more intensive fishing, which have increased the efficiency of photosynthesis and the capture of wild aquatic species.

The global food system is heavily reliant on fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources. The modern civilization is impossible without mass-scale mobilization of many man-made materials. Despite their importance, materials are often overlooked in economic analyses and media coverage. The attention is focused on immaterial and intangible phenomena such as GDP growth, national debt ratios, new initial public offerings, mobile connectivity, and artificial intelligence.

Modern civilization has managed to prosper and develop without the use of semiconductors, microchips, personal computers, smartphones, social media, and puerile apps. However, the provision of energy and materials required to embody electronics inventions is essential to their existence. Silicon is the signature material of the electronic age, but it is not an existential constraint on modern civilization. Although producing large, high-purity silicon crystals is complex, energy-intensive, and expensive, the raw material is super-abundant. Annual output of electronic-grade silicon is very small compared to other indispensable materials, and despite the usefulness and transformative power of electronics, they are not an existential necessity.

The four pillars of modern civilization, cement, steel, plastics, and ammonia, are essential materials needed in larger quantities than other inputs, and their indispensability, ubiquity, and demand size make them vital to modern societies. They are not readily replaceable by other materials and are necessary for the functioning of modern civilization.

The mass production of four essential materials - steel, cement, plastic, and ammonia - heavily relies on fossil fuels, contributing to a significant portion of global CO2 emissions. Currently, there are no commercially available alternatives to these established processes. Despite proposals and experimental techniques to produce these materials without fossil carbon, none have been commercialized, and it would take decades to displace existing capacities. The importance of these materials is highlighted, and their basic properties and functions, as well as the technical advances and inventions that made them, are briefly outlined.

Ammonia is the most important of the four essential materials due to its role as a dominant nitrogen fertilizer in feeding 40-50% of the global population. Plastics, steel, and cement do not have comparable existential constraints. Ammonia is a simple inorganic compound made up of nitrogen and hydrogen, and its synthesis was surprisingly challenging. The history of its invention includes accidental discoveries.

The accidental discovery of Teflon and the intentional synthesis of ammonia were two significant scientific breakthroughs. The need for increased food production due to population growth and dietary shifts drove the development of ammonia synthesis as a means of securing a reliable source of nitrogen for fertilizer. The discovery of phosphatic fertilizers provided a reliable source of phosphorus, but nitrogen remained a challenge due to the exhaustion of guano deposits and limited imports of Chilean nitrates.

The need for a reliable source of nitrogen to support food production drove the development of ammonia synthesis, which converted nitrogen from the atmosphere into plant-assimilable compounds. This breakthrough was achieved in 1908 by Fritz Haber and his team, who used an iron catalyst and high reaction pressure. The discovery was significant in ensuring a sustainable supply of nitrogen for fertilizer to support the expanding population of the industrializing world.

The Haber-Bosch process, which produces ammonia for synthetic fertilizer, was successfully commercialized in Germany in 1913. The process was used for making explosives during WWI, and despite economic crises, it continued to expand in the following decades. The use of natural gas and better catalysts helped increase ammonia production eightfold, enabling the Green Revolution in the 1960s. China became a major player in the production of ammonia-urea plants in the 1970s, leading to increased food supplies and the abolition of urban food rationing by 1984.

China's dependence on synthetic ammonia for crop production is essential to feed 60% of its population. Globally, synthetic nitrogen feeds half of humanity, making the Haber-Bosch synthesis a crucial technical advancement. However, the percentage of the population dependent on synthetic nitrogen would vary with different diets and farming practices. About 80% of global ammonia production is used for fertilizing crops, and the rest is used for various purposes. To reduce dependence on nitrogenous fertilizers, food waste should be cut, and fertilizers used more efficiently.

Urea is the most commonly used nitrogenous fertilizer, with ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, and calcium ammonium nitrate being less important. Nitrogen fertilizers applied to fields are difficult to control due to natural losses, and slow-release compounds or precision farming are the only effective direct solutions. Indirect measures such as higher food prices and reduced meat consumption are unpopular. About 80% of synthesized ammonia is used as fertilizer, with nearly 60% applied in Asia, and rich countries should reduce their application rates. China and India have opportunities to reduce excessive fertilizer applications.

Africa has low nitrogen usage and hopes to increase it for greater food self-sufficiency, but genetic engineering for nitrogen-fixing capabilities has yet to deliver, and the commercial extent of seed inoculation is unclear. Plastics are synthetic materials formed from monomers and are malleable, creating various shapes. Global output is dominated by thermoplastics such as low- and high-density polyethylene and polypropylene, while thermoset plastics resist softening when heated.

Thermoplastics, such as PVC and PP, have low density and high strength, making them popular for heavy-duty applications like pipes and chemical tanks. They are also used in car interiors, aircraft interiors, and carbon-fiber reinforced plastics for aircraft airframes. The first thermoset material was created in 1907, leading to the production of Bakelite, the first industrial plastic used for a variety of products, from electric insulators to telephones. PVC was discovered in 1838, but it wasn't until the interwar years that large-scale syntheses began, with research funding from companies such as DuPont, ICI, and IG Farben.

The production of various plastics began in the 1930s with cellulose acetate, neoprene, polyester, polymethyl methacrylate (plexiglass), and styrene. Nylon and Teflon were also produced during this time. Polyurethanes, polyethylene, and methyl methacrylate were introduced by IG Farben and ICI. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was patented in 1941 and became widely produced in the 1950s, leading to exponential growth in demand for plastics. By the end of the 20th century, there were 50 different types of plastics on the global market, and demand continued to rise.

Plastics are ubiquitous in modern life and have become indispensable in healthcare, particularly in the treatment of infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the reliance on plastic items in hospitals, including personal protective equipment (PPE). Plastics are used in a wide range of medical applications, from flexible tubes to sterile packaging, and have expanded from small industrial parts to large-scale applications such as car bodies and airplane interiors.

PVC is the primary component in over a quarter of healthcare products and is found in numerous household items. Concerns about plastic pollution are rising, but it is not an argument against their proper use. Steel, a ubiquitous and recyclable material, is made by reducing cast iron's carbon content and has superior physical properties compared to stone. Preindustrial steel was expensive to produce and hence not commonly used.

Steel is a widely used metal with high compressive and tensile strength, heat resistance, and hardness, making it suitable for a variety of applications from construction to surgical instruments. It comes in four major categories, including carbon steels, alloy steels, stainless steel, and tool steels, and is magnetic except for some stainless varieties. Steel is essential to modern civilization and is used to make countless visible and invisible critical components.

Steel is ubiquitous in our homes and everyday lives, used in a variety of items from cutlery to cars. It is also critical to the construction of skyscrapers, bridges, and transportation equipment. Steel is used in the foundations and frames of buildings, as well as in lighting poles, traffic signs, crash barriers, ski lifts, and wind turbines. Steel towers are also used for radio and TV transmissions and high-voltage electricity transmission. Steel is the largest component in transportation equipment.

Steel is used in various transportation modes including planes, cars, trains, and ships. High-strength steel makes vehicles lighter. Container ships use steel crates of standardized dimensions to transport cargo. Machines and tools used in manufacturing are mostly made of steel, and the machines that make machines are powered by electricity, which requires steel.

Steel is used in various industries including nuclear reactors, oil and gas wells, refineries, and hospitals. The metal is also used in weapons of destruction. Questions remain about the availability of iron ore, the environmental impact of steelmaking, and whether it can be produced without fossil fuels. Iron is abundant in the Earth's crust and steel can be made without using fossil fuels.

The world produces 2.5 billion tons of iron ore annually and has over 800 billion tons in resources with a ratio of 300 years for production. Steel is easily recyclable through melting in an electric arc furnace, but it requires a significant amount of electricity. Vehicle and household appliance recycling have high rates, while the dismantling of large ocean-going vessels is the most challenging recycling operation. Affluent economies recycle most of their automotive scrap and structural steel with the US recycling over 65 percent recently.

Recycling of steel scrap has a similar rate to beverage and food steel cans, and it is one of the world's most valuable export commodities. Primary steelmaking still dominates with blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces producing liquid iron and steel. Recycled steel accounts for almost 30 percent of the total annual output, with national shares ranging from 100 percent to less than 12 percent. Final steps involve the transfer of hot steel to continuous casting machines to produce steel products. Ironmaking is highly energy-intensive, with about 75 percent of the total demand.

Steel production requires a significant amount of energy and is responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions. The energy cost of recycled steel is lower than that of integrated steelmaking. Global steel production requires about 6% of the world's primary energy supply. Steelmaking is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Cement production is also responsible for a significant share of CO2 emissions. Cement is produced by heating ground limestone and clay in large kilns, and concrete consists largely of aggregates and water.

Concrete is a widely used material in modern civilization, made of aggregates, water, and cement. It is strong in compression but weak in tension and often reinforced with steel. Concrete is used in urban buildings, foundations, basements, walls, and ceilings, as well as in infrastructure such as pipes, tunnels, and roads. Roman cement was an early precursor to modern concrete.

The Pantheon is made of non-reinforced concrete and still stands after nearly two millennia. Modern cement was patented in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin and was named Portland cement. While concrete is good in compression, tension can break it apart. The first reinforcing patents were filed in the 1860s and the breakthrough came in 1884 with reinforcing steel bars. Modern cement rotary kilns made it possible to use affordable concrete in large projects. The Ingalls Building in Cincinnati became the world's first reinforced concrete skyscraper in 1903. Thomas Edison believed that concrete should replace wood in construction.

Edison tried to build cheap concrete homes and furniture, but failed. Swiss engineer Robert Maillart pioneered reinforced concrete bridges, and his designs are still used today. Architects Auguste Perret and Frank Lloyd Wright used concrete in their designs. Pre-stressing improved the tensile strength of reinforcing steel, with the first major pre-stressed design being Eugne Freyssinet's Plougastel Bridge. The Sydney Opera House is a famous pre-stressed concrete structure.

Reinforced concrete is commonly used in large modern buildings and transportation infrastructure, such as viaducts, port piers, airport runways, and dams. The US Interstate Highway System contains about 50 million tons of cement and 1.5 billion metric tons of aggregates. The world's largest dam, China's Sanxia (Three Gorges), has almost 28 million cubic meters of reinforced concrete.

Annual American cement consumption rose significantly in the 20th century, with recent rates around 100 million tons a year. However, China is now the world's largest cement producer, with an output of about 2.2 billion tons in 2019. China's rise in cement production has led to the country having the most extensive systems of freeways, rapid trains, airports, and giant hydro stations. Despite its popularity in construction, ordinary construction concrete is subject to environmental assaults and is not highly durable.

The extensive use of concrete in modern infrastructure has led to the problem of its deterioration, with factors such as exposure to chloride and reinforcement steel corrosion causing cracks and exfoliation. The durability of concrete structures varies widely, with many deteriorating after just two or three decades. This means that there will be an unprecedented burden of concrete renewal and removal during the 21st century, particularly in China. Recycling of crushed concrete and reinforcing steel is possible, but not cheap. Developed countries need to fix decaying infrastructure, while the poorest countries need concrete floors to improve hygiene and reduce disease. As a result of aging populations, urbanization, and economic globalization, more concrete will likely be abandoned.

Abandoned concrete structures, such as factories and bunkers, are becoming increasingly common worldwide. The demand for steel, cement, ammonia, and plastics is expected to be met during the first half of the 21st century, but it is unlikely that these industries will eliminate their dependence on fossil fuels by 2050. Low-income modernizing countries will require large-scale increases of all basic materials, similar to China's recent material advances. This will require large amounts of fossil carbon, which will continue to be a price we pay for our reliance on these materials. As renewable energy conversions expand, larger amounts of old materials and unprecedented quantities of materials will be required.

The growing dependence on materials required for green technologies is often overlooked. Wind turbines require large amounts of steel, cement, and plastic, which are difficult to recycle, and electric cars rely on vast quantities of lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, graphite, and other raw materials. Meeting the demands of a green economy would require significant amounts of these materials, leading to an increase in material dependencies. The future rates of adoption for electric vehicles are uncertain, but meeting the demand for them would require a significant increase in the production and processing of raw materials.

The growth of electric vehicles would significantly increase the demand for raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, requiring a drastic expansion of their extraction and processing. Meeting this demand would require additional conversions of fossil fuels and electricity, making modern civilization fundamentally dependent on them until renewable conversions are used. Globalization drives the transportation of goods and crude oil through interlocking steel containers and giant tankers, highlighting the dependence on fossil fuels for material flows.

The world is interconnected through various forms of international movements, including trade, migration, and tourism. Products such as iPhones are assembled in China from parts sourced from various countries and then distributed globally. Travel for leisure has led to overtourism in some popular destinations. The COVID-19 pandemic led to new overtourism crises but did not stop companies from advertising new cruises. Global trade, foreign direct investment, and currency trading are significant, but official statistics underestimate the actual flows.

Globalization is a multifaceted process that involves cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, investment, people, and information, leading to growing interdependence of economies, cultures, and populations. The process is not new, and labor arbitrage is just one of its drivers. Globalization is not inevitable and has already gone too far in some ways, leading to a consensus for readjustment. It is a human construct and not a force of nature. The recent attention to globalization is due to its extent, not its novelty, and has a considerable history.

China's success in attracting foreign direct investment cannot be attributed solely to low labor costs, as it offers a combination of factors such as political stability, a large population, and a growing domestic market. China has benefited greatly from globalization, with poverty reduction of 94% from 1980 to 2015, but there are also concerns about the loss of jobs, labor arbitrage, inequality, and immiseration.

Globalization is made possible by technical advancements in prime movers and communication, contingent on prevailing political and social conditions. Globalization involves the movement of mass and transmission of information and investment on large scales. Energy conversion is necessary for these transfers, and inanimate prime movers such as steam engines and internal combustion engines have played a crucial role in enabling large-scale, low-cost, and reliable interchange. There is nothing inevitable about the continuation and further intensification of globalization, as the significant post-1913 retreat and recent concerns about supply chain security demonstrate.

The concept of globalization is not new and has existed in various forms throughout history. Pre-European discovery of America, there were relatively intensive and intercontinental ties through regular sailing from ports such as Berenike and Basra. However, the scattered linking of parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa is not truly global. The inclusion of the New World in 1492 and the first circumnavigation of the Earth in 1519 began to satisfy this definition. A century later, commercial exchanges tied European states with the interior of Asia, India, and the Far East, as well as with coastal regions of Africa and with both Americas. Some early links were enduring and transformative, such as the East India Company's trading of textiles, metals, spices, and other items to and from the Indian subcontinent.

The Dutch East India Company dominated trade with Southeast Asia and Japan for centuries, and the era of globalization can be traced through the technical capabilities that enabled global connections. The four eras of globalization are identified by markers such as maximum power and speed of transportation and the ability to communicate over long distances. The limits of globalization were initially determined by animate power, as human and animal muscles restricted the weight and speed of goods that could be carried. Wooden sail ships were limited in capacity and speed, and the Silk Road caravans traveled only about 25 kilometers per day.

Dutch ships traveling to Asia in the 17th and 18th centuries were slow and lacked accurate navigation, taking an average of eight months to reach Batavia and another month to reach Dejima. Average speeds were 4.7 km/h, limiting trade in bulk commodities. Sailings to Japan were restricted to 27 ships a year and one arrival a year during the 1790s. Nearly 1 million people made the journey between 1595 and 1795, but only 15% survived until their destination.

During the early modern era (1500-1800), societies engaged in long-range interchanges and experienced benefits from trade and cultural exchanges. The urban elites of the Dutch Republic's Golden Age showed markers of this affluence through possessions and experiences depicted in paintings. The "New Luxury" was real and evidenced in products of good craftsmanship. The presence of Africans in Amsterdam, popularity of maps and atlases, consumption of sugar and exotic fruits, and import of spices, tea, and coffee were other examples of early globalization, but had limited economic impact.

Prior to the combination of more reliable navigation, steam power, and the telegraph, globalization was incipient, selective, and limited with no substantial nationwide impacts. The first quantitative leap in globalization occurred with the use of these technologies, allowing for larger ship capacities and faster speeds. However, sailing ships remained competitive for another four decades due to their independence from the length of the voyage, while steamships required more fuel for longer distances.

The adoption of more efficient engines, steel hulls, screws, and large steam engines allowed for faster and more reliable shipping, covering 30-40 km/hour compared to 20 km/hour for clippers. The practical telegraph was developed during the 1830s and 1840s, and undersea cables connected all continents by the end of the century. This allowed trading to take into consideration demand and prices in different parts of the world, leading to profitable international exchanges, such as the rapid rise in frozen American meat exports. The role of the telephone remained limited during this time.

Advances in communication technology and transportation led to the first wave of large-scale globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Global trade quadrupled from 1870 to 1913, and leisure travel became more accessible through steam-powered trains and ships. While intercontinental communication was still expensive and monopolized, the ability to move goods and people across long distances greatly impacted the global economy and social culture.

Advances in transportation and communication technology allowed for increased mobility and the ability to travel longer distances, including for leisure and political reasons. The rise of steam globalization also had a cultural impact, as seen in the literary works of Joseph Conrad. The replacement of steam engines with diesel engines and the invention of airplanes powered by gasoline engines and radio communication further promoted globalization in the early 20th century.

Diesel engines were developed in the late 1800s and first used on a ship in 1912, leading to more efficient transportation with less fuel. By the 1930s, the aviation industry had developed airplanes capable of profitable long-distance flights, but these were still noisy and had limited cruising altitude. The first London to Singapore link in 1934 took eight days with 22 layovers.

Radio communication and navigation were crucial for better sea and air travel, and rapidly adopted by the public. Marine diesels and reciprocating aircraft engines were key in enabling globalization during the interwar decades and contributed to the outcome of World War II. The US emerged as the dominant power after the war and aided in the economic recovery of Western Europe through the Marshall Plan.

Countries surpassed prewar industrial production levels by 1949, except for Communist economies which were highly autarkic. A distinct period of post-1950 globalization was enabled by technical advances including more powerful diesel engines, gas turbines, superior designs for intercontinental shipping, and quantum leaps in computing and information processing. The progress in computing was revolutionized by the patenting and commercialization of transistors, which led to the creation of microchips and the world's first microprocessor in 1971.

The achievements in technical capabilities before 1973, including diesel engines, container ships, and microprocessors, still hold critical importance in modern society, with no immediately available alternatives. Between 1950 and 1973, global economic expansion saw significant increases in output for steel, cement, ammonia synthesis, and plastic, as well as rising energy demand, with crude oil consumption almost sixfold. Diesel engines made the greatest difference in enabling mass-scale transport in the global economy, with intercontinental trade in bulk cargoes highly dependent on them.

The increase in oil exports in the mid-20th century led to the development of larger oil tankers with capacities of up to 500,000 deadweight tons. This allowed for the increase in Middle Eastern oil shipments. Intercontinental natural gas shipments became possible with the introduction of liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers in the 1960s. The growth in intercontinental trade required new modes of specialized shipping such as bulk carriers and the greatest innovation came in 1957 when Malcolm McLean transformed the shipping industry with his containerized shipping concept.

Malcolm McLean's containerized shipping concept became a commercial reality in 1957 with the launch of the first true container ship. New roll-on/roll-off vessels were designed to meet the needs of expanding intercontinental car exports, with Japanese designs gaining US market share. The efficiency of diesel engines improved, and their maximum power increased, allowing for the development of larger ships. Gas turbines were also developed, with the first stationary turbine for electricity generation appearing in 1938.

Jet engines were independently developed in England and Germany, with Frank Whittle and Hans von Ohain being the first to test efficient and reliable turbines to power military planes. The British industry produced the first commercial jetliner in 1949 with the Comet, but it was overshadowed by Boeing's 707 in 1958. Boeing continued to innovate with the development of the first wide-body jetliner, the 747, which was initially conceived as a freighter. The 747's size was made possible by the deployment of four Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, and it became the most revolutionary plane design in history, with its first commercial flight taking place in 1970.

Turbofan engines, which allow for a larger mass of slower-moving air to bypass the combustor, generate higher thrust with less noise during takeoff compared to turbojet engines. The 747, with a bypass ratio of 4.8:1, revolutionized intercontinental travel and transported billions of people to a growing number of destinations with declining costs and increasing safety. The introduction of wide-body jetliners was closely tied to the integration of the global economy, enabling mass-scale tourism, intercontinental immigration trips, and educational exchanges. The advances of globalization were also closely tied to the miniaturization of components for computing, information processing, and communication.

The development of electronic computing was limited by large assemblies of vacuum tubes, which required frequent maintenance and replacement. The invention of practical transistors and integrated circuits in the 1950s and 1960s allowed for smaller and more efficient computing devices. Intel's development of the world's first microprocessor in 1969 paved the way for personal computers and portable electronics. The years between 1950 and 1973 saw rapid global economic growth.

The period between 1950 and 1973 saw a rapid global economic growth that was disproportionately concentrated in the West. The major Western European economies and Japan became the most dynamic traders, while America's share in world trade gradually declined. Despite the expansion of trade, international travel, migration, and study abroad remained relatively limited. The OPEC-driven oil price increases caused globalization to weaken and recede, but this retreat did not affect all economic sectors.

The foundations for a new wave of globalization were laid through effective adjustments, enabled by technical factors, and progressed further than any preceding waves with the participation of China, Russia, and India in global trade, finances, travel, and talent flows. The gradual opening of China began in 1972 and accelerated after China joined the WTO in 2001, becoming the world's largest exporter of goods. Despite rising tensions between the US and China, it is too early to forecast a long-term retreat in trade or return to ever-tighter economic integration.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet state, every major economy became open to foreign investment and intensified international trade, with populations previously forbidden to travel freely joining mass-scale tourism and taking advantage of new opportunities to emigrate and work and study abroad. India has shown clear departure from poor performance with per capita GDP growth and annual growth of merchandise exports slightly behind China's. India's rise has coincided with the marginalization of the Congress party, while both Russia and China have retained many attributes of central economic and social control.

The text discusses globalization and its various markers, such as international trade, foreign direct investment, and migration. It notes that favorite destinations for tourism and education vary among countries, with Russians favoring Mediterranean countries and Chinese preferring Thailand, Japan, and Europe. While the financial crisis of 2008-2009 temporarily impacted globalization, overall trade has continued to increase, with foreign direct investment and migration playing important roles. The progress of globalization has been measured and analyzed, with previously isolated countries such as Russia, former European communist economies, China, India, some African countries, and Brazil experiencing significant gains. By 2017, the global connectedness of China was as high as that of Japan, Russia's rivaled that of Sweden, and India could be compared with Singapore.

The text discusses the technical advances that have made unprecedented globalization possible since the 1970s, with shipping, flying, navigating, computing, and communication all experiencing significant improvements. Post-1973 globalization has tripled the mass of seaborne trade, with a major shift in its composition from tanker traffic dominated by crude oil and refined products to goods, reflecting the rise of Asia and China as the world's leading source of consumer goods and increased integration and interdependence among countries. The increases in capacity, efficiency, and reliability of prime movers and essential infrastructure have played a significant role in this globalization.

The global merchant fleet has experienced significant growth in capacity over the past 45 years, with the tonnage of oil tankers and container ships more than tripling and increasing 4.5 times respectively. The global container fleet has also expanded tenfold to 5,152 ships in 2019. China now holds a significant share of container traffic, while the combined US and Japanese share has decreased. Maximum ship sizes have also increased substantially, with a twelve-fold increase in vessel capacity between 1973 and 2019. Freight trains and truck transportation have adapted to this mass-scale conversion to container shipping, and intermodal chains now bring goods from China's interior to the loading docks of Walmart in Missouri. Expensive and high-value goods are often transported by air, with global airfreight increasing 12-fold between 1973 and 2018. Scheduled passenger traffic has also increased nearly 17-fold.

International passenger travel has increased significantly, with the equivalent of flying nearly half a billion people a year on international flights. Europe remains the most visited tourist destination, with France, Spain, and Italy being the most visited countries. Chinese tourists now spend twice as much as Americans, and there have been moves to limit the numbers of visitors in some major cities. Advances in navigation, tracking, computing, and communication have enabled the transportation and delivery of goods and people. These advances are based on the ability to place more components on integrated circuits, in accordance with the prediction made by Gordon Moore in 1965, with progress doubling every two years.

The development of microprocessors has advanced from small-scale to ultra large-scale integration, with the number of transistors increasing by seven orders of magnitude from 1971 to 2019. This has led to new capabilities such as massive data transfers, instant communication, and highly accurate navigation, aided by global positioning systems. Anyone with a computer or mobile phone can now see worldwide shipping and aviation activities in real-time through websites like MarineTraffic.

Globalization has enabled greater international economic integration through the intensified flows of energies, materials, people, ideas, and information, aided by technical advancements. Flight tracking makes it possible to trace changing flight paths due to shifting jet streams, cyclones, or volcanic eruptions. However, technical advances do not make continued progress inevitable, as seen in the significant retreat from economic globalization during the first half of the 20th century due to large-scale tragedies and reversals of national fortunes.

The 20th century saw major global events that affected economic globalization, including the establishment of the USSR, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the stock market crash of 1929, the Second World War, and the Cold War. The retreat of economic globalization was substantial during this time. However, the post-1990 return of China to international commerce and the dismantling of the Soviet Empire led to the accelerated pace of globalization seen in the 21st century. This degree of globalization is not inevitable and could be weakened by future developments, but many changes that occurred over the past two generations are here to stay. Self-sufficiency in raw materials is impossible for most countries, and many rely on food imports.

Mass-scale manufacturing precludes companies from assembling products in every city, and millions of people still desire to visit iconic distant places. Rapid disruptions would come with high costs attached. However, history shows that recent states are unlikely to last for generations. The pro-globalization sentiment has been weakening due to the accelerated deindustrialization of North America, Europe, and Japan and the shift of manufacturing to Asia, which has brought changes ranging from risible to tragic. A mass-scale, rapid retreat from the current state is impossible.

Globalization has led to the loss of manufacturing jobs in America, particularly in the mid-2000s, causing a rise in midlife mortality among white non-university-educated men due to deaths of despair. McKinsey's analysis shows that goods-producing value chains have become significantly less trade-intensive, and only about 18% of global goods trade is now driven by lower labor costs. Additionally, global value chains are becoming more knowledge-intensive and rely increasingly on highly skilled labor. The expansion of global value chains stopped in 2011 and since then has slightly declined. There are also fears about globalization's impact on national sovereignty, culture, and language.

COVID-19 has reinforced sentiments questioning globalization's downsides, including economic and social inequality, and led to appeals for reorganization of global supply chains. Institutions such as the OECD, UN Conference on Trade and Development, Swiss Re, and Brookings Institution have suggested options for more resilient production networks, repatriating manufacturing, and reshoring advanced manufacturing to create good jobs. The pandemic has highlighted concerns about the state's fundamental role in protecting its citizens and the need to reduce reliance on imports from distant places to withstand global trade interruptions.

The dependence on a small number of suppliers in China and India for essential products like PPE and medications has created irresponsible governance and security concerns. The pandemic has prompted a wave of reshoring of manufacturing, and a 2020 survey showed that 64% of American manufacturers are likely to reshore. The author does not forecast specific numbers but appraises the most likely outcomes, and it appears that the peak of globalization may have passed and its ebb may last for years.

The advances of modern civilization have been successful in reducing risks from food supply, housing, hygiene, public health measures, engineering and transportation safety. International treaties have been established to promote reliability and safety. The reduction of risks will continue to be a quest to survive in a world full of dangers.

Despite declining frequency and casualties of violent conflicts, risks still exist in the modern world due to the complexity of our bodies, natural processes, and human errors. Media reports constantly expose people to man-made and natural dangers, diseases, and risks in daily activities. These include terrorism, chemophobia, natural catastrophes, incurable cancers, viruses, and worries about artificial intelligence and genetically engineered organisms. The list of risks can be easily extended, and it may seem like we are exposed to more risks than ever, but the incessant reporting of these events or possibilities may be exaggerated.

The modern world is full of risks, but many misperceptions and irrational risk appraisals exist. Risk analysis has revealed the origins and prevalence of these misperceptions. To find the least risky diets associated with a long life, the author will ignore media claims and scientific journal publications and rely on participants' recollections of their diets. The author will also compare man-made and natural risks.

Studies on what we should eat have been inconsistent and subject to flaws. Instead, we can look at populations with the longest average life expectancies, such as Japan, and examine their unique dietary features. Japan has had the highest average longevity since the 1980s, with a combined life expectancy of about 84.6 years in 2020. Women in Japan have the longest life expectancy at about 87.7 years. The factors contributing to longevity are complex, but examining unique features of a population's diet can provide insight.

Traditional ingredients in the Japanese and Chinese diets are nutritionally equivalent. The Japanese diet has transformed over the past 150 years, with the consumption of milk, meat, and baked goods increasing, and mean blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and body weight rising. Despite this, heart disease did not increase and longevity improved. Japan and the US consume similar amounts of food energy per day.

The article discusses the differences in the diets of Americans and Japanese people. While both consume enough carbohydrates and protein, Americans consume significantly more fat and sugar than the Japanese. The article suggests that adopting a Japanese or Mediterranean-style diet, which is rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, may help reduce the risk of premature mortality.

The article compares the diets of Spaniards and Japanese people. After joining the EU, Spain's consumption of meat and sugar increased significantly, while its consumption of olive oil and wine declined. Despite these changes, Spain's cardiovascular mortality has continued to decline, and life expectancy has been rising.

Spain has significantly increased its life expectancy since 1960, with a longevity prospect of over 83 years by 2020. While Japanese eating habits have a slight edge in terms of longevity, a similar outcome can be achieved by eating as they do in Valencia. Making dietary changes based on convincing data can have a vastly consequential impact on longevity. Other risk assessments, such as comparing the risks of intercontinental flying and downhill skiing, require accurate comparative yardsticks.

Comparative evaluations of different risks can be made accurately. People's risk tolerance differs for voluntary and involuntary activities. People engage in risky activities they perceive as controllable, but fear perceived involuntary exposure, such as terrorist attacks. People engage in risky activities daily, like driving and smoking. Disparities between tolerating voluntary risks and avoiding wrongly perceived involuntary risks can become bizarre, such as refusing vaccination.

The text discusses how people often misperceive risks and have irrational fears, such as with vaccines, nuclear power, and microchips. Despite evidence that nuclear power has prevented air pollution-related deaths, many people distrust it. France derives much of its electricity from nuclear power and has not experienced negative health effects, yet many Germans believe it should be eliminated. Misperceptions of risk can lead to societal issues, and researchers are studying how to address them.

The text discusses how our perceptions of risk are subjective and influenced by factors such as familiarity and cultural circumstances. Dread plays a significant role in risk perception, and terrorist attacks are a prime example. Exaggerated news coverage intensifies these fears. In contrast, driving presents familiar, recurrent, and voluntary risks, leading societies to tolerate a global death toll exceeding 1.2 million annually. However, societies would not accept the same death toll from industrial or structural disasters.

Individuals have different levels of risk tolerance, with some engaging in high-risk activities like base jumping while others adopt a fatalistic view towards risks. Fatalistic individuals may underestimate risks and avoid taking action to prevent mishaps. Traffic fatalism is prevalent among some drivers, leading to dangerous driving behavior. While it is difficult to change individuals' risk behaviors, understanding and quantifying risks can help compare their impacts. However, comparing risks is a complex task and there is no universal metric to do so.

The risks of everyday life are varied and include health risks such as heart attacks and falls, food-associated risks, driving risks, exposure to asbestos and bacteria, seasonal flu and pandemic viruses, severe allergic reactions, natural disasters, and homicide rates. There is also a risk associated with generic drugs that come from countries like China and India. Quantifying these risks can be challenging, but it is important to understand their potential impacts.

The article discusses how age and sex affect the leading causes of mortality, with heart disease being the dominant cause of death for men in their 50s to 70s and breast cancer being the most feared disease for women in their mid-30s to mid-60s. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death among females after their mid-60s, while dementia and Alzheimer's replace heart disease as the leading cause of death for both sexes over 80. Quantifying risks of mortality is challenging, and a universal metric is impossible. However, a standard denominator comparing annual frequencies of causes of death per 100,000 people reveals surprising outcomes, with homicides taking almost as many lives as other leading causes of death.

The article discusses using a more insightful metric, such as fatalities per person per hour of exposure, to compare causes of death. Homicides have a higher risk of exposure as they can happen at any time, whereas motor vehicle accidents only occur when someone is driving. Overall death rates are well-monitored worldwide, but mortality heavily depends on the average age of the population. Micromorts, a one-in-a-million chance of death per specific exposure, are not ideal for comparisons due to their non-uniform denominators.

The text discusses mortality rates and how they are calculated, including data on deaths due to specific diseases and injuries. The overall mortality rate of well-off countries is around 10/1,000, with cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of mortality. The risk of dying from common activities such as driving or flying can be estimated by ascertaining the totals of specific populations engaged in these activities and then estimating the average hours of annual exposure. The risk of dying from natural disasters such as hurricanes or tornadoes can also be calculated using similar methods.

The text discusses various mortality rates and risks of death associated with different activities. The overall risk of natural demise in affluent countries is low, with a rate of 1 person among 1 million dying every hour. Specific risks vary by sex and age, with older individuals having higher mortality rates. Medical errors in hospitals are a significant cause of preventable deaths, with studies suggesting that they may be responsible for as many as 400,000 deaths per year in the US.

A study found that between 1990 and 2016, 123,063 deaths were associated with adverse effects of medical treatment, mostly due to surgical and perioperative errors, resulting in an average of 4,750 deaths per year. This translates to about 1.2 10-6 fatalities per hour of exposure and increases an elderly male's risk of death due to AEMT by no more than about 20-30% during an average hospital stay. Comparatively, risks associated with participating in risky activities are higher.

The distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk exposures is not always clear, as some risky activities may be necessary or have limited options. Driving and flying are globally common activities, and accurate counting of deaths and assumptions about population and time of exposure are necessary to assess associated risks. In the US, traffic fatalities have increased slightly to about 40,000 a year, and estimating the time spent driving can help assess risks.

Driving is an order of magnitude more dangerous than flying, with an average chance of dying going up by about 50 percent compared to staying at home. Driving risks vary among gender and population groups, with the risk of dying in a motor vehicle accident being highest for Native American males. Commercial flights have become even safer during the 21st century despite recent losses.

Air travel has become increasingly safe, with the number of fatalities per 100 billion passenger-kilometers flown decreasing significantly since the late 1950s. Expressing fatalities in terms of risks per hour of exposure shows that flying is only about 3 percent of the general risk of mortality while aloft, and even for a septuagenarian male, the risk while aloft rises by a mere 1 percent. Base jumping is the riskiest activity with a brief duration carrying a high probability of death.

The article discusses various activities and their associated risks, such as base jumping having a fatality risk of 1 in 2,317 jumps, while driving a car has an exposure risk of 5x10-7 per person per hour. Skiing and skydiving also have relatively low fatality risks compared to base jumping. The article also mentions the number of fatalities caused by terrorist attacks on US soil between 1995 and 2017, with the majority of deaths occurring on September 11, 2001.

The article discusses the individual exposure risk of terrorism, which averaged 6x10-11 countrywide and was two orders of magnitude higher in Manhattan. The risk of being alive increases by just a few percent in countries with higher terrorist attack rates. However, these comparisons have inherent limits as terrorism threats are unpredictable and difficult to avoid. The article also compares the risks of natural hazards and extreme sports, with some countries more frequently subject to certain catastrophic events than others.

The risk of being killed by natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes is relatively low, with an average fatality exposure rate of 10-9 or even lower. Despite the recurrent occurrence of these disasters, people continue to live in areas prone to them because the risk of death is considered acceptable. For instance, between 1984 and 2017, only 1,994 people were killed by tornadoes in the United States, and most of these deaths occurred between March and August. Similarly, earthquakes in Japan have killed about 33,000 people since 1945.

The average fatality exposure rate of natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and lightning, is low, ranging between 1-10 10-10 and 5 10-10. The rate for American hurricanes has reduced to about 8 10-11 due to advanced public warnings, evacuations, and satellite technology. However, the frequency and economic cost of natural disasters worldwide have been increasing, raising concerns. The largest reinsurance companies have been monitoring these trends for decades.

The world's largest reinsurance companies are highly dependent on making proper calls when insuring against major natural disasters. The upward trend of natural catastrophes is unmistakable, with an increase in annual frequency and economic losses. Insured losses range mostly between 30-50% of total losses, with the 2017 record reaching nearly $150 billion. While growing populations and economies contribute to greater exposure, changes in natural hazards themselves, such as warmer atmosphere and prolonged droughts, intensify the risks.

Effective measures can be taken to reduce the impacts of natural or man-made hazards, but truly exceptional events like deaths caused by space debris or falling meteorites remain a very low, rare risk. While a report estimated that there should be 91 deaths a year from space debris, there have been no recorded deaths since 1900. Even if one person were killed every year, the rate would be much smaller than just being alive. In terms of catastrophic events that could end modern civilization, those risks belong to a different perception category and are strongly discounted due to their distant future likelihood.

The 2020 pandemic showed that we are not prepared for global risks that occur every few decades. There are two types of global risks: frequent viral pandemics and rare but deadly natural catastrophes. It's uncertain if we could improvise shelters in time if a nearby supernova exploded. The likelihood of a catastrophic event like a gamma-ray burst affecting Earth is low. The risk of a collision between Earth and an asteroid is uncertain and depends on various assumptions.

Geological timescales are too long to calculate risks per year. The impact of an asteroid would depend on where it hit. Americans could worry about the Yellowstone supervolcano erupting again, which has erupted nine times in the past 15 million years. There is uncertainty about the interval between eruptions, but if it is shorter than expected, a new eruption could be overdue. The consequences of the eruption would depend on its magnitude, duration, and prevailing winds. The last eruption released 1,000 cubic kilometers of volcanic ash, and prevailing winds carried it over Wyoming.

The article discusses two potential natural disasters that could cause significant indirect casualties. One is a massive volcanic eruption that could bury productive agricultural land and cause long-term problems such as flooding. The other is a coronal mass ejection from the sun that could cause a catastrophic geomagnetic storm, disrupting technology and causing widespread indirect casualties. Seismic monitoring and advance warning could help with evacuation in the case of a volcanic eruption, but there is little that can be done to prepare for a geomagnetic storm.

The article discusses past coronal mass ejections from the sun and their effects on early telegraph and telephone networks. It notes that more recent events have caused power outages and warns of the vulnerability of modern electronic systems, including GPS navigation and banking, to a massive geomagnetic storm. While warning systems can provide some advance notice, once the ejection reaches a certain point, there may be only minutes to react. The article emphasizes the potential global scale of the impact, leaving us without electricity or information.

The article discusses the potential impact of a solar storm, like the 1859 Carrington Event, on modern technology and infrastructure. Such a storm could severely damage communication, power grids, and banking systems, causing trillions of dollars in damage and loss of life. While the probability of such an event is uncertain, experts estimate it to be between 0.02% and 12% over the next decade. Despite the potential consequences, it is difficult to fully prepare for such an event and we can only hope it does not occur.

The article discusses the impact of viral pandemics, which are low-frequency but unpredictable threats that have occurred several times in the past century. The mortality rates of past pandemics ranged from 3/100,000 to 38/100,000, with COVID-19's impact still ongoing. Despite this, pandemic threats did not appear among the top global risks until COVID-19, and early advice against taking preventive measures was given. Influenza is a more common cause of respiratory deaths, accounting for about 2% of all annual respiratory deaths.

The mortality rate of seasonal flu is much lower than the two late 20th-century pandemics and COVID-19. Seasonal flu mortality is skewed towards old age, while the 1918 pandemic disproportionately affected people in their 30s and the 1957-1959 pandemic affected ages 0-4 and 60+. COVID-19 mortality is highly concentrated in the 65+ cohort, especially among those with significant comorbidities, and children are relatively unaffected. Many excess deaths among older people cannot be prevented due to our efforts to extend life expectancy. During the peak US COVID-19 mortality, people over 65 accounted for 81% of deaths, and those younger than 35 for 0.1%. Most deaths in the 1918 pandemic were due to bacterial pneumonia.

Tuberculosis was common during the 1918 pandemic, and people with tuberculosis were more likely to die of influenza. This explains the pandemic's middle-age mortality and clear maleness. Tuberculosis has been eradicated in affluent countries, and pneumonia is treatable with antibiotics, but seasonal influenza mortality cannot be prevented. Risks can be minimized by isolating vulnerable individuals and developing better vaccines. Many people do not reduce easily reducible risks like wearing seat belts, never speeding, and installing sensors in dwellings. People and governments find it difficult to deal with low-probability but high-impact events.

The text discusses the challenges in minimizing the impact of rare but significant events, such as natural disasters, on individuals and societies. While some areas have programs in place to mitigate risks, most do not. Many risks are beyond our control, such as genetic predispositions to diseases. Eliminating large areas subject to natural disasters is impossible, so the focus is on precautions such as earthquake-proof buildings and early warning systems to improve survival odds. However, some catastrophes are still beyond our control.

The text discusses how we habitually underestimate familiar risks while exaggerating unfamiliar ones. We also tend to overestimate risks from recent experiences and underestimate risks that have receded from memory. This amnesia is exemplified by the way we responded to COVID-19, which caught us ill-prepared for dealing with high-impact but low-frequency risks such as pandemics that occur once in a decade, generation, or century. The text highlights factors that contribute to our amnesia, such as the absence of modern news diffusion during previous pandemics.

The aftermath of catastrophic events often leads to irrational responses and exaggeration of their probability of recurrence. Public reactions are driven by fear of the unknown, rather than a rational appraisal of actual consequences, which leads to excessive focus on unlikely outcomes. Terrorists exploit this reality and force governments to take costly measures while neglecting low-cost measures that could save more lives, as seen in the American attitude towards gun violence.

The number of Americans killed by guns far exceeds the number killed by terrorists, and even exceeds the number killed in motor vehicle accidents, with African American males being particularly at risk. The idea of leaving Earth for a new celestial abode is presented as a solution to problems, but is unlikely due to the impossibility of creating a suitable atmosphere on other planets. The quest for minimizing risks remains a driving force in human progress.

To ensure the survival and flourishing of our species for the next 5,000 years, we need to avoid transgressing safe planetary boundaries which includes critical biospheric boundaries such as climate change, ocean acidification, depletion of stratospheric ozone, atmospheric aerosols, interference in nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, freshwater use, land use changes, biodiversity loss, and various forms of chemical pollution. Colonizing Mars is not a feasible solution unless we create genetically re-engineered humans.

This text discusses the three irreplaceable existential requirements for human existence - breathing, drinking, and eating - and how they are dependent on natural goods and services such as oxygen, water, soils, photosynthesis, and biodiversity. While the provision of these resources affects natural goods and services, some effects range from marginal to obviously negative, and even outright destructive. Breathing is critical to survival, and while the provision of oxygen is not in danger, excessive water extraction from deep aquifers, serious water pollution, overgrazing, and deforestation can have negative impacts on the natural resources required for human existence.

Breathing is essential for human survival as the brain cells start to die within five minutes of cerebral hypoxia. Oxygen is the most acutely limiting resource for human survival, with the resting frequency of breathing being 1220 inhalations per minute, and the daily adult per capita intake averages almost 1 kilogram of O2. The global population's annual intake of oxygen is about 2.7 billion tons, which is an utterly insignificant fraction of the element's atmospheric presence of about 1.2 quadrillion tons of O2. There is no danger of people or animals reducing the oxygen level through breathing, and even the greatest conceivable burning of the Earth's plants would consume only about 0.1 percent of the atmosphere's oxygen.

During the Amazon rainforest fires, politicians and news media tried to scare people into believing that the world would start suffocating due to the loss of oxygen, but this is a myth. The burning of the rainforest is a highly regrettable policy, but it will not deprive the planet of its oxygen. This misinformation highlights the problem of relying on tweets and biased interpretations instead of established scientific facts. While the underlying science is often complex and uncertain, it is clear that the function of lungs is to enable gas exchange, not to produce oxygen.

Lungs consume about 5% of the total oxygen we inhale, while photosynthesizing organisms consume virtually all of the oxygen produced during nocturnal respiration. Despite imbalances in oxygen flows, its atmospheric presence has remained stable. However, water supply, which is not in absolute shortage but unevenly distributed and poorly managed, is a critical resource that is almost universally mismanaged. We waste water enormously and have been slow to adopt effective changes to reverse undesirable habits and trends.

Access to adequate volumes of drinking water is a matter of basic survival, and other water needs include personal hygiene, cooking, laundry, productive activities, and growing food. Different sectors and categories of water use complicate intranational and international comparisons. National per capita consumption is the best way to assess water footprints, which includes green, blue, and grey water components, as well as all virtual water. Domestic blue water use varies across countries, ranging from just over 29 in Canada and 23 in the USA to about 11 in France and 7 in China.

Water consumption varies greatly among countries, with high usage in industrialized nations and low usage in many African countries. Food imports contribute significantly to water usage, with Japan and South Korea being the highest users of virtual water. The availability, sufficiency, and vulnerability of water resources have been widely studied, with estimates of water-stressed populations ranging from 1.2 to 4.3 billion people. The production of food has had a significant impact on the Earth's ecosystems and is responsible for a third of non-glaciated land use. The area of land used for food production has increased but has stabilized in affluent economies, and the growth of new farmland has slowed down. The future of water resources and food production is uncertain.

To meet the increasing demand for food, Africa will need to expand cultivated land while Asia should limit extensions, and Europe, North America, and Australia should see further declines in cultivated land. Improved farming practices, reduced food waste, and moderate meat consumption could reduce the amount of land needed for food production. Agricultural intensification and elimination of wasteful practices could increase yields while reducing fertilizer and pesticide use. Ammonia synthesis allows for the provision of nitrogen, and adequate amounts of potassium and phosphorus are also available. Reserves of potassium could last for nearly 90 years, and although there have been concerns about imminent phosphorus depletion, new discoveries and recycling could extend current reserves.

There is no imminent phosphorus crisis as the world's reserves and resources are adequate to meet fertilizer demand for the next few hundred years. However, the real concern is the environmental consequences of their unwanted presence in the water, mostly due to soil erosion and precipitation runoff. Eutrophication, the excessive growth of algae due to the enrichment of waters with previously scarce nutrients, is a major issue caused by the addition of phosphorus from fertilizers and nitrogen from animal and human waste. The worldwide efficiency of nitrogen uptake by crops has declined, leading to the contamination of waters. Phosphorus can be removed and reused as fertilizer.

Excessive algal growth caused by eutrophication leads to oxygen-depleted zones in coastal waters, affecting fish and crustaceans. Better agronomic management and reduced meat consumption are essential solutions. Sub-Saharan Africa needs more nitrogen and phosphorus to avoid chronic dependence on food imports. Climate change is a significant factor that could affect atmospheric oxygen, water availability, and food production. The greenhouse gas effect is necessary for life but has been unintentionally enhanced by human activity, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels. Modern science identified this phenomenon over a century ago, but potential risks were ignored for generations.

The abundance and efficient conversion of fossil fuels have been the main drivers of economic growth, but they also contribute to global warming through CO2 emissions. The Earth's atmospheric temperature is regulated by trace gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, which allow for the existence of liquid water and support life. However, too much of these gases can cause the greenhouse effect and lead to environmental consequences. The challenge of addressing global warming is significant, but necessary to ensure a livable planet.

The natural greenhouse effect is caused by trace gases intercepting outgoing infrared radiation, while water vapor is the most important absorber. Trace gases, particularly carbon dioxide, have always controlled the Earth's natural warming. Human actions, such as farming and the use of wood and charcoal, have contributed to an additional, man-made greenhouse gas effect. Water vapor does not control atmospheric temperature, but rather is controlled by it, and increasing temperatures lead to more evaporation and higher atmospheric water concentrations, resulting in additional warming.

Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, cement production, rice cultivation, landfills, and nitrogenous fertilizers have caused a significant increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide since the industrialization period. CO2 levels have increased by over 50% since the late 18th century, and methane and nitrous oxide concentrations have more than doubled. These gases absorb radiation to varying degrees, with methane and nitrous oxide having a greater impact than CO2. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and SF6 are industrial gases that have a strong greenhouse effect, but their concentrations are minuscule, and CFCs were outlawed by the 1987 Montreal Protocol.

Greenhouse gas emissions from fuel combustion, deforestation, methane, and nitrous oxide account for anthropogenic warming effects. This will eventually lead to negative environmental impacts with significant social and economic costs. The discovery of carbon dioxide-induced global warming was made before the development of climate change models and electronic computers. The phrase "global warming" began to gain prominence in the late 1980s, following the establishment of organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The issue has become a significant topic in scientific research, government reports, and media coverage.

The coverage of global warming is often poorly communicated and has become more apocalyptic over time. However, our understanding of the greenhouse effect and the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions has been known for over a century. Scientists such as Fourier, Foote, Tyndall, and Arrhenius were some of the first to link CO2 with global warming and explain its effects on climate. Increases in CO2 concentration lead to rising atmospheric temperature, a concept known since 1861.

Arrhenius accurately estimated climate sensitivity in 1908, predicting that doubling atmospheric CO2 would raise Earth's surface temperature by 4oC. Revelle and Suess warned in 1957 that mass-scale fossil fuel combustion is an unprecedented geophysical experiment that will release carbon stored in sedimentary rocks over millions of years. This prompted the measurement of background CO2 concentrations in Mauna Loa and the South Pole. Global warming is felt most in the polar regions and reduces temperature differences between night and day, mainly due to changes in clouds, water vapor, and energy transport.

Annual increases in carbon dioxide levels have been constant and predictable since the late 1950s. The theoretical value of climate sensitivity was estimated to be within the range suggested by Arrhenius over a century ago. Despite warnings and confirmation of climate sensitivity, little progress has been made in response to global warming. Recent assessments of Earth's climate sensitivity indicate that substantial warming is likely to occur and effective decarbonization efforts have been lacking.

Technical advances and production shifts have led to some decarbonization progress, but without a deliberate focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The recent turn toward decarbonizing electricity generation has been negated by rising emissions in China and elsewhere in Asia. Greenhouse gases have caused the planet to re-radiate less energy, resulting in a rise in global temperature, particularly in higher latitudes. The five warmest years in the past 140 years have occurred since 2015, and consequences of global warming range from earlier flowering of cherry trees to worrisome temperature records.

The burning of fossil fuels has caused a marginal decline in atmospheric oxygen, but the decline is not significant enough to affect oxygen concentration in the short term. The melting of high-mountain glaciers due to heat waves has been extensively studied and predicted in computer models. The impact of global warming on water and food supply remains a concern.

There is no risk of impaired breathing due to a decline in atmospheric oxygen from forest fires or fossil fuel combustion. Populations living at high altitudes have adapted to lower oxygen concentrations. However, there are concerns about the future of water supply, with some major river basins remaining above the scarcity level, while some already water-scarce areas will see further deterioration. Demand-driven freshwater scarcity will have a greater impact than shortages induced by climate change, so managing demand is the best option. The US has successfully reduced per capita water usage as an example of effective management.

US water consumption has only increased by 4% since 1965 despite a population increase of 68% and quadrupled GDP. Per capita water use decreased by nearly 40% and water intensity of the US economy declined by 76%. Desalination can alleviate drinking water shortage, but it is more expensive than freshwater from reservoirs or recycling. Most of the world's food production will continue to rely on rainfall. Photosynthesis is a lopsided exchange of water for CO2, and global warming will intensify the water cycle.

Global warming will intensify the water cycle, resulting in more precipitation and water available for storage and use, but precipitation will not increase everywhere, and it will be more irregular in some regions. CO2-rich environment can increase crop water use efficiency, resulting in stable crop yield even with reduced precipitation. However, global food production contributes significantly to global warming through CO2 and methane emissions, which present opportunities for improvements and adjustments.

Reducing beef consumption and improving livestock farming practices can reduce carbon emissions and improve soil health. By redistributing cropland, reducing food waste, and making dietary adjustments, it's possible to feed the future population of 10 billion people without exceeding planetary boundaries. While concerns about water supply may increase, we have the means to address them. We need to reduce excessive food production in wealthy countries and improve food supply in low-income countries. However, fossil fuel subsidies will still be necessary for food production.

Fossil fuels will remain the primary driver of global climate change for decades to come, and the uncertainty surrounding the issue makes a resolute response difficult. The spread of COVID-19 serves as a reminder of the limitations of human understanding, despite advances in science and technology. Climate change is an even more complex phenomenon than a viral pandemic and requires a long-term solution.

The understanding of climate change is far from perfect, requiring more observations, studies, and better models. However, energy-saving measures should have been implemented regardless of global warming concerns. There are opportunities for reducing energy use in various sectors, but we have neglected steps that could limit long-term impacts and have promoted the diffusion of energy conversions that boost fossil energy consumption. Inadequate building codes and the widespread use of SUVs are examples of these omissions and commissions. Proper insulation and efficient heating can extend the lifespan of houses.

Triple-paned windows, high-efficiency gas furnaces, and properly sealed rooms can save energy and reduce carbon emissions. However, these options are not widely adopted in cold and hot climates. The widespread use of SUVs emits 25% more CO2 than standard cars, and they have become the second-highest cause of rising CO2 emissions after electricity generation. The high energy cost of modern food production and food waste presents opportunities for reducing CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions.

The article questions the need for airlifting food globally, suggests better pricing to reduce food waste, and criticizes the lack of action to address increasing greenhouse gas emissions despite decades of international climate conferences. Affluent countries have reduced emissions slightly, while India and China have increased emissions significantly. The article suggests that immediate and profitable actions should be taken to combat global warming instead of waiting for modeling exercises or international conferences.

The article criticizes international climate conferences, including the Paris accord, for their inability to codify specific reduction targets by the world's largest emitters and their failure to address rising emissions from factors such as China's coal extraction and increasing demand for SUVs and air conditioners. The article emphasizes the need to recognize the fundamental realities of global warming, including the already committed global warming from past emissions and the limited time left to prevent a 1.5C temperature rise.

Despite commitments made to reduce global warming, it appears that it is highly likely that the world will warm by 2.3C. The IPCC report outlines a scenario to halve global emissions of CO2 by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050. However, some scenario-builders provide unrealistic assumptions about achieving a zero-carbon future, ignoring the complexities and realities of our energy and material systems. For instance, a scenario assuming a 52% drop in global per capita energy demand by 2050 to keep global warming below 1.5C is wishful thinking and contradicts recent past trends.

The suggestion that demand for energy will decline due to reduced ownership and digitalization is unrealistic. Though gradual declines in ownership are likely, halving the demand is arbitrary and unlikely. In the Global South, where growth has been on an entirely different scale, even a tenth of China's recent growth would result in a significant increase in car ownership and air conditioners. The assumption that these countries will not follow the same path as China is questionable.

The latest global production gap report shows major fossil fuel consumers aim to produce 120% more fuels by 2030, which is not consistent with limiting global warming. A group of energy researchers at Princeton University recognizes the only way to achieve net-zero emissions is through mass-scale carbon capture and storage of emitted CO2. This would require the creation of an entirely new gas-capture-transportation-storage industry, which would handle 1.3-2.4 times the volume of current US crude oil production. The majority of carbon storage is to take place along the Texas Gulf Coast, requiring the construction of about 110,000 kilometers of new CO2 pipelines.

Achieving complete decarbonization by 2050 is a tame goal compared to the third scenario, which extends the goals of the US Green New Deal to 143 countries, decarbonizing 80% of global energy supply by 2030 with renewable energy. However, claims of cheap and instant effectiveness, creating well-paying jobs, and ensuring care-free futures for coming generations are not backed up by explanations of how the four material pillars would be achieved, making the goal unrealistic. The dismantling of the existing transmission infrastructure of the US oil and gas industry and the historical experience with cost overruns are challenges.

The article criticizes the unrealistic nature of rapid-speed transformation narratives which aim for zero carbon emissions by a certain date. It highlights the challenges in achieving such goals, particularly in relation to the technical and economic difficulties of transitioning away from carbon-dependent activities. The article questions the feasibility of achieving these goals in a short period of time and suggests that realistic long-term forecasts indicate that fossil fuels will continue to supply a significant portion of global primary energy.

The article argues that it is unrealistic to expect rapid global decarbonization by following arbitrary goals and that it is not possible to instantly change the course of a complex system of fossil carbon and energy conversion. The author suggests that we can make a significant difference by displacing coal-fired electricity with natural gas and expanding solar and wind electricity generation, moving away from SUVs, and reducing inefficiencies in construction and energy use. The article questions why some scientists continue to offer wishful previsions and why people readily believe them, and suggests that more will be said about this in the closing chapter.

The scientific method should always prioritize doubt as the foundation for knowledge. Environmental concerns have evolved over time, with some becoming more pressing than others. It's important to maintain a critical perspective when dealing with complex environmental, technical, and social models, as they can lead to exaggerated predictions about the future.

Some models predict the availability of inexpensive, carbon-neutral energy, while others propose that fossil fuels can be used without limit thanks to new technologies that can remove and recycle CO2 from the atmosphere. These assumptions are often based on wishful thinking and should be viewed as heuristic exercises, not prescient descriptions of the future. It's important to remain critical of such models and avoid comparing them to recent developments in electronics, as the underlying systems are vastly different.

There are no simple solutions to global environmental challenges such as deforestation, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and global warming, but reducing carbon emissions through improved efficiency, system design, and moderation of consumption can limit the rate of global warming. However, complete displacement of fossil carbon by non-carbon energies would require significant cuts in the standard of living in affluent countries and denying modernization to developing nations. Predicting the success of decarbonization efforts is difficult due to unpredictable changes in national fortunes and interactions between the atmosphere and biosphere. While climate models have their limitations, they can still assume continued global progress.

Climate models accurately predict the overall rate of global warming, but predicting the specific outcomes is challenging due to unpredictable shifts in national fortunes. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as an analogy, as even a highly accurate forecast of total interim mortality provides no specific guidance for national responses. The rise of China and India since 1980 has changed the circumstances of responding to rising global trace gas emissions. In 1980, China was not a major contributor to emissions, but it is now the largest, making it difficult to predict the outcomes of climate change policies.

In 1980, China's economy was much smaller than Nigeria's and had minimal carbon emissions, while only top Communist Party leaders had air conditioning. However, by 2019, China had become the world's largest economy in terms of purchasing power, had high per capita GDP, produced the most cars globally, had a vast train network, and emitted 30% of the world's CO2. The USA and EU28's share of emissions significantly declined, and future power to enact change lies in Asia's modernizing economies. The transformation of sub-Saharan Africa has been slower, but its population is set to double, and its electricity future is likely to have a high-carbon lock-in.

Global warming has both good and bad news for the world's forests. They have been a large carbon sink, locking away about 2.4 billion tons of carbon annually, and one-third of the world's vegetated area has been greening. However, the biosphere has lost 14% of its trees due to cutting, and older trees are accounting for a larger share of this loss, resulting in younger and shorter forests that can't store as much carbon. Rising sea levels may not affect low-lying coasts and island nations in the Pacific, as shown by a recent analysis of four decades of shoreline change in Tuvalu. The unpredictability of human behavior affects the evolution of societies.

The complex and uncertain nature of biospheric processes and the rise and fall of nations make it difficult to predict the future of fossil fuel consumption and decarbonization efforts. The key challenge is the global resolve to deal with critical environmental issues. There are available solutions such as reducing energy consumption, technical fixes, and changing food consumption habits. However, these measures are often overlooked in discussions about low-carbon revolutions that rely on unrealistic expectations of massive technological innovations. Effective steps towards decarbonization will be gradual and costly.

Human activities have transformed the environment for centuries, causing harm to the biosphere. Solutions exist, but their implementation at a global scale requires considerable economic and social costs. It is uncertain if we will take meaningful action to address environmental issues. Discussions about the future range from apocalyptic visions of environmental catastrophes to techno-optimism that promises eternal salvation through artificial intelligence and the Singularity, a point in time where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence.

The author argues that modern anticipations of the future tend to gravitate towards either an apocalypse or singularity, and this extreme polarization is accompanied by a greater propensity for dated quantitative forecasts. However, these forecasts are often no better than simple guesses and should be avoided or used primarily as evidence of prevailing expectations and biases. The author advises against relying on them for a better understanding of what the future may look like.

The quantity of modern forecasting has become inversely proportional to its quality, with many forecasts being baseless qualitative predictions or the simplest extensions of past trajectories. Quantitative forecasts fall into three categories, with only the first category providing solid insights and good guidance. Demographic projections, especially fertility forecasts, are among the best examples in this limited category. The third category, quantitative fables, teems with numbers but has questionable assumptions and processes with different real-world endings.

The average number of children per woman has been below the replacement level for a generation and has decreased from 1.8 to 1.5 over the past decade, with little chance of substantial increase. Short-term forecasts for population decline in countries such as Poland have a narrow range of highly plausible outcomes. On the other hand, short-term projections involving complex systems, such as the adoption of electric cars, result in a broad range of possible outcomes. Combustion engines continue to offer advantages over electric cars.

Past near-term forecasts for the electrification of road transport have overestimated the actual share, and there is a broad range of forecasts for the share of electric vehicles on the road by 2030. Failed predictions include nuclear electricity reliance, ubiquitous supersonic intercontinental flights, and the Y2K glitch shutting down all computing in 2000. The abundance of failed forecasts receives unprecedented distribution and attention.

The use of complex computerized scenarios for forecasting does not eliminate the risks of making assumptions, and in fact, increases the possibility of errors. Classic forecasting failures include the intellectual duel between cornucopians and catastrophists, with concerns about population growth being a prominent issue. While catastrophists made predictions of runaway population growth leading to doomsday scenarios, the reality was that such growth rates could not continue forever on a finite planet, and global population growth peaked at around 2.1% before the end of the 1960s.

Global population growth peaked at around 2.1% before the end of the 1960s and has since declined to just 1.08% in 2019. As a result, half of the world's population will be living in countries with a total fertility rate below the replacement level by the early 2020s. This decline in population growth invites new catastrophic calculations, such as the possibility of not having enough people of working age to feed humanity in the future. Another popular catastrophic vision concerns the depletion of mineral resources, with forecasts of imminent peak oil extraction reaching new heights of existential fear-mongering in the 1990s and 2000s.

Human ingenuity has allowed us to meet the growing global population's food, energy, and material needs despite catastrophists' predictions. Undernourishment has decreased, fertilizer use and cereal crop harvests have increased, and crude oil extraction has risen. Techno-optimists have a poor track record, and the belief in the all-encompassing power of nuclear fission was a failure. Nuclear energy only produced about 10% of the world's electricity in 2019, a fraction of what was expected in the 1980s.

The pursuit of nuclear-powered flight and natural gas production through nuclear explosions was irrational and unsuccessful. No plane powered by nuclear fission ever took off, and several nuclear bombs were detonated in the quest for expanded natural gas production. Plans for using nuclear explosions for various activities were also abandoned. Currently, there are frightening prophecies and unrealistic promises surrounding environmental degradation and climate change. Journalists and activists warn of a climate apocalypse, and some claim that we have a limited amount of time left to avert a global catastrophe.

The author questions the constant stream of apocalyptic predictions regarding climate change and argues that they do not offer practical solutions for addressing the issue. Some believe that a sustainable future is achievable and that technological advancements will eventually solve any problem. The author also references a previous UN official who warned of a 10-year window to address the greenhouse effect, suggesting that the deadline has likely passed.

The author suggests that extreme predictions about the future, whether apocalyptic or utopian, are unlikely to come to pass. Long-range forecasting is inherently difficult due to the interplay of complex systems and the potential for unpredictable events. While humans have a record of adapting and achieving new solutions, the challenge of addressing issues on a large scale adds to the difficulty of making accurate predictions.

Higher yields can reduce the demand for farmland, but yield gaps remain substantial, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Relative gains in future performance should not be mistaken for an absolute decoupling of output and input variables as global population continues to grow and demand better nutrition. Urban agriculture using hydroponic cultivation may produce some vegetables, but cannot meet global food demand for high carbohydrate, protein, and lipid supply crops.

Efficiency improvements and relative dematerialization have physical limits, and new alternatives have offsetting costs. For example, primary aluminum requires five to six times more energy to produce than primary steel, and reducing nitrogen fertilizer use is not an option for millions of people in Africa who need more protein. The huge development gap is often ignored in global needs assessments. Departing from established practices in a civilization that serves nearly 8 billion people is challenging.

The constraints of mass-scale dependencies make it difficult to substitute or transition to new ways of producing essential inputs, such as cement and steel. Past examples of rapid shifts are not good guides for predicting future accomplishments due to differences in magnitude. Decarbonization has been slower than the displacement of traditional biomass by fossil fuels, despite an impressive rise in the supply of new renewables. The total energy demand being an order of magnitude higher in 2020 than in 1920 makes it more challenging to displace fossil fuels.

Even if decarbonization triples or quadruples its pace, it would still leave fossil fuels dominant by 2050 due to the scale of the challenge. A category mistake is made when assuming that everything can move faster in the electronically enabled world. Satisfying the demands of billions of consumers in endeavors such as food and energy production requires infrastructures that are distinct from making a social media profile or buying a new smartphone. Many fundamental processes that enable modern electronic devices are long-established techniques.

Despite claims about superior innovations, the fundamentals of our lives will not change drastically in the coming 20-30 years. Steel, cement, ammonia, and plastics will endure as the four material pillars of civilization, and a major share of the world's transportation will still be energized by refined liquid fuels. Electricity that powers all electronic gadgets is mostly generated by steam and gas turbines, which cannot be replaced by photovoltaic cells or wind turbines in a similar time span. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a reminder of our limited capacity to chart our futures, and that is unlikely to change dramatically.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the emptiness of claims about disruptive scientific and technical advances, such as artificial intelligence and genome editing, and illustrated the limitations of our godlike capacity to control our fate. The impact of the pandemic in rich countries shows that some future-forming endeavors, such as manned space flight and personalized medicine, have been misplaced. We must hope that the next pandemic will come only after decades of relatively uneventful seasonal viral epidemics.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the inadequacies and unpreparedness of affluent countries, including the US and Europe, to deal with a major crisis. Despite spending billions on military and hyping up 5G networks, these countries were unable to provide basic medical supplies to their healthcare workers. Instead, they had to rely on imports from countries like China, where most of the manufacturing of these essential items is concentrated. The response of the affluent world to COVID-19 has been ironic given their over-reliance on technology and military spending, which proved irrelevant in dealing with the pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted our unrealistic attitude towards fundamental realities, which stems from forgetting traumatic experiences. Despite experiencing notable episodes such as the 1957-1958 pandemic, we have not learned from them or left a deep imprint in our collective memory. This may be due to larger losses during World War II or a collective perception that temporary excessive mortality is beyond our control. Forgetting is an essential complement of remembering and old patterns and approaches soon resurface to set the stage for another round of failures. This is exemplified by the lack of fundamental departures and reforms taken after the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the persistent issue of strategic lapses in response to pandemics, and governments are unlikely to ensure adequate provisions for future pandemics or change the profits of mass-scale manufacturing. People will resume global mingling, and we will need to repeatedly reconcile ourselves to realities beyond our control. The pandemic's impact on older cohorts is linked to efforts to extend life expectancy, and comorbidities of old age are predictors of excess viral mortality. Nonetheless, steps will likely be taken to prolong life expectancy.

The increasing share of people over 65 years of age due to natural aging and prolongation of life raises concerns about coping with future pandemics, disproving the idea of automatic progress. Lowering the overall risk of living through understanding and control of variables has not made existential perils more predictable or manageable. Successes in avoiding worst outcomes have been due to being prescient, vigilant, and determined to find effective fixes.

The text highlights the fortunate avoidance of nuclear confrontation due to safeguards and uncertain judgments. However, recent failures such as the Fukushima disaster and the Boeing 737 MAX accidents suggest that the ability to prevent failures has not uniformly increased. The consequences of these failures have been significant, including public distrust of fission and profound impacts on Boeing's production and future designs.

The text argues that failures in complex structures and processes like Fukushima and the Boeing 737 MAX accidents are inevitable, and unpredictable manifestations will continue to occur. The urgency and difficulty of tackling global climate change are emphasized, and the need for a global accord and binding commitments from the top five greenhouse gas producers is highlighted. Despite decades of global meetings and assessments, no such agreement has been reached, and the Paris accord lacks specific emission-reduction targets.

The non-binding pledges of the world's largest emitters would result in a 50% increase in emissions by 2050. Effective commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be expensive and will take at least two generations to show results. This raises the problem of intergenerational justice, as people tend to discount the future. Mitigating global climate change through pricing carbon would not provide economic benefits for the current generation, and even drastic reductions will not show convincing benefits for decades due to the long-lasting effects of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

The lack of globally binding commitments for climate change mitigation pushes the break-even point and measurable temperature declines further into the future. A climate-economy model predicts the break-even year to be around 2080 for mitigation efforts launched in the early 2020s. The generation born near the middle of the 21st century would be the first to experience cumulative economic net benefit from climate-change mitigation policy. However, it is unclear if people are willing to sustain this course for over half a century, especially as low-income countries continue to rely on fossil carbon. The pandemic has highlighted the difficulty of having coherent and uniform measures for global challenges. Basic measures for ensuring the security of basic food, energy, and material supply with minimal environmental impact should be considered while realistically appraising possible steps.

The text emphasizes the uncertainty of predicting the future and the need to approach planetary challenges with humility. The author highlights the limits of our understanding and the need to use accumulated understanding with determination and perseverance to avoid an early end of days. The text uses the example of predicting the state of the world in 2020 to illustrate the impossibility of describing the advances, complexities, and nuances of the world that we have created by our accomplishments and failures during the intervening years. The future will emerge from our accomplishments and failures, and while we might be clever enough to foresee some of its forms and features, the whole remains elusive even when looking just a generation ahead.

The text highlights the unpredictability of the trajectory of rise and fall of nations and the unforeseen developments in various areas of human progress over the past 75 years. The author points out that nobody in 1945 could have predicted the world's current population growth, advances in health and technology, widening economic inequality, environmental degradation, and the prevalence of misinformation. The author also suggests that predicting the extent of future technical innovations, events shaping nations' fortunes, and decisions that will determine the fate of civilization remains uncertain despite recent preoccupation with global warming.

Population trajectory will play a crucial role in determining the future and extreme forecasts suggest vastly different outcomes. Basic population forecasts veer apart after a single generation and the implications of extreme values shape different economic, social, and environmental trajectories. Living with fundamental uncertainties limits our ability to act with foresight. Pandemics are also a major uncertainty and we can expect at least two or three such events before 2100. The future is a mixture of progress and setbacks, with seemingly insurmountable difficulties and near-miraculous advances.

In the world of fiction, processes and outcomes are handled in qualitative terms, while today's world is full of numbers. The new fairy tales and tragedies always come with the latest sums and numbers, but the quality of these numbers is often questionable. The world is full of quantification, and people measure everything from their friends on Facebook to their investment prowess. The outcome of the future is not predetermined, and it depends on our actions.

Numbers can be difficult to comprehend, especially when they are too large or too small. Orders of magnitude, which represent the total number of digits following the first digit of a whole number, can help in understanding large numbers. This method is based on a decadic logarithmic scale and is useful for numbers that go beyond millions, such as billions and trillions. The wealth gap between the richest people in the world and the poorest can be as much as 10 orders of magnitude.

The range of magnitudes that separate humans from each other is greater than any seen among animals, with some humans having separated themselves further than natural evolution could. Orders of magnitude are used to indicate large numbers and are expressed using Greek prefixes such as kilo and mega. The International System of Units provides a table of these prefixes. Travel speeds in preindustrial societies differed by only a factor of two, while modern societies have an unprecedented range of magnitudes in travel speeds.

The text highlights the tremendous gains in power and speed that have occurred since the preindustrial era, from slow walking to jetliners, and from horses to vehicles and planes with much greater power. Understanding these orders of magnitude is crucial to understanding the modern world.
