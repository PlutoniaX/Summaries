 The text is a book titled "The Metaverse And How It Will Revolutionize Everything" by Matthew Ball. 

 The book is divided into three parts: "What is The Metaverse?", "Building The Metaverse", and "How The Metaverse Will Revolutionize Everything". 

 The book contains 15 chapters covering various aspects of the Metaverse such as networking, computing, virtual world engines, interoperability, hardware, payment rails, blockchains, and more. 

 The book also discusses the potential impact of the Metaverse on businesses and society.

The text introduces Vannevar Bush's hypothetical electromechanical device called the Memex, which could store all books, records, and communications and link them through keyword association. Bush became influential in American history, serving as the chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and later establishing the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), a federal agency that received unlimited funding primarily for secret projects during World War II. President Roosevelt approved the atomic bomb program, and Bush played a key role in managing it.

After World War II, Vannevar Bush wrote two essays, "Science, the Endless Frontier," which called for government investment in science and technology, and "As We May Think," which detailed his vision of the Memex. Bush's Memex influenced the creation of hypertext, a concept of the World Wide Web, which led to the establishment of the Internet Engineering Task Force and the World Wide Web Consortium. Science fiction often provides the public with a clear view of the future, and in 1968, the film 2001: A Space Odyssey imagined a future with thin display devices despite few households having color TVs.

The development of futuristic technology in science fiction films has taken longer than expected to become reality, but advancements in tablet devices and space travel have made such concepts closer to reach. Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook will transition into a metaverse company, with a division focused on the Metaverse and elevating the head of Facebook Reality Labs to chief technology officer. In October 2021, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook will be changing its name to Meta Platforms to reflect its shift to the Metaverse, and investments in the Metaverse will reduce operating income by over $10 billion in 2021, with further investments expected in the coming years.

Other companies, such as Microsoft and Nvidia, have also announced their initiatives and plans for a Metaverse. The gaming industry had two of its largest-ever IPOs in Unity Technologies and Roblox Corporation, both of which centered their corporate histories and ambitions in Metaverse-related narratives. The term "Metaverse" was mentioned more than 260 times in SEC filings and catalogued in more than a thousand stories by Bloomberg in 2021. The interest in the Metaverse extends globally, with China's Tencent and South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT announcing their visions for the Metaverse, and South Korean gaming giant Krafton also expressing interest.

Krafton committed to launching a PUBG Metaverse while Chinese internet giants Alibaba and ByteDance registered Metaverse trademarks and acquired VR and 3D-related start-ups. The Communist Party of China began its biggest-ever crackdown on domestic gaming, with policies limiting minors' video game play and facial recognition software to enforce them. Tencent and Alibaba pledged $15 billion each for sustainable social value. The CCP warned against blindly investing in the Metaverse, emphasizing the importance of looking to countrymen and women.

China and the European Parliament expressed concerns over the potential significance of the Metaverse. The Communist Party of China viewed it as a threat to their centrally planned country, while European Union negotiator Christel Schaldemose called the plans "deeply, deeply worrying." The Metaverse has generated much hype and skepticism, but the response of large companies reflects a growing belief that it is the next great computing and networking platform.

The impending shift to the Metaverse is expected to revolutionize everything, and preparations for it are happening earlier and proactively compared to the past shift to mobile and cloud computing. The book "The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything" offers a clear, comprehensive, and authoritative definition of the Metaverse and aims to help readers understand how it will alter daily lives, work, and thinking. The author believes the collective value of these changes will be in the tens of trillions of dollars. The book refers to Meta Platforms as Facebook for clarity, and the Security Times cited the author when discussing the Metaverse.

"The Metaverse" by Matthew Ball provides a clear and insightful analysis of the key technologies that will bring the Metaverse and how it will change lives globally, creating trillions of dollars of value. The book serves as a guide to deciphering the hype and shaping our shared future online and offline. The contents include a brief history of the future, confusion and uncertainty, a definition of the Metaverse, building the Metaverse, and how it will revolutionize everything. The Metaverse was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash.

Neal Stephenson's book "Snow Crash" describes a persistent virtual world called the Metaverse, which is larger than Earth and affects almost every aspect of human existence. The Metaverse has more than 15 million human-controlled avatars and offers opportunities and refuge to millions. However, it is dystopian and has made life in the real world worse. Stephenson's vision inspired modern technology, including Jeff Bezos' founding of Blue Origin, and he worked there part-time until 2006.

Neal Stephenson's novel "Snow Crash" has had a significant impact on modern technology, including inspiring Jeff Bezos to found Blue Origin and influencing the vision of Keyhole, now known as Google Earth. Stephenson was also Chief Futurist at Magic Leap, a mixed reality company inspired by his work. His novels have also influenced cryptocurrency projects, decentralized computer networks, and CGI-based movies. However, Stephenson warns against a literal interpretation of his works and reminds us that he was not the first to introduce the concept of the Metaverse. Stanley G. Weinbaum wrote about a similar concept in 1935.

This text highlights several works of science fiction literature that explore the potential consequences of immersive and virtual technologies. These works include Ray Bradbury's "The Veldt," which depicts a family whose children become addicted to a virtual reality nursery, as well as Philip K. Dick's "The Trouble with Bubbles," in which consumers use a product called Worldcraft to create their own virtual worlds that eventually lead to destruction. Isaac Asimov's "The Naked Sun" describes a society that shuns physical contact in favor of remote interactions via holograms and 3D televisions. William Gibson's "Neuromancer" popularized the term cyberspace, and the Wachowskis' film "The Matrix" portrays a world where humans are unknowingly trapped in a simulated reality.

The article explores the concept of the Metaverse, a virtual universe that is fully immersive and interconnected. While many works of science fiction have depicted the Metaverse as a dystopian world, there is no reason to assume that it will necessarily be negative in reality. The history of virtual worlds and collaboration shows a progression towards the Metaverse that is focused on creativity and self-expression. The concept of the Metaverse is also linked to the Memex, an idea for an infinitely interconnected system of documents proposed by Vannevar Bush in the 1940s.

The history of digital communication and virtual worlds began with text-based Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) in the 1970s, which led to the creation of Multi-User Shared Hallucinations (MUSHs) and Multi-User Experiences (MUXs) that allowed participants to collaboratively define the world and objectives. The release of the graphical Commodore 64 online game Habitat in 1986 allowed users to see virtual environments and characters, and had greater control over the in-game environment. Habitat was described as a multi-participant online virtual environment, or cyberspace, and users were in charge of the laws and expectations of their virtual world.

Habitat, a commercial hit in the 1980s, was the first game to use the term avatar and allowed users to create their virtual world and maintain order through rules and authorities. Isometric 3D virtual worlds emerged in the 1990s, followed by full 3D virtual worlds and graphic/symbol-based tools to facilitate world-building. OnLive! Traveler launched spatial voice chat in 1998, and Keyhole, which later became popular as Google Earth, was created in the same year. These advancements paved the way for the development of the Metaverse.

Google Maps was updated to include partial 3D maps and real-time traffic overlays. Second Life, a virtual platform, was launched in 2003 and attracted over one million users in its first year, with real-world organizations establishing their presence on the platform. Second Life also featured a stock exchange, where transactions were made directly between buyers and sellers. Linden Labs, the developer of Second Life, operated more like a government than a game-maker, enabling a thriving economy through infrastructure, technical capabilities, and tools to attract more developers and creators.

Second Life enabled users to import virtual objects and textures, with an annualized GDP exceeding $30 million by 2005 and half a billion dollars by 2009. Minecraft and Roblox brought virtual world platforms to a mainstream audience and allowed for large-scale collaborations, including building cities as large as Los Angeles. Minecraft was also used to create a functioning cellphone and re-create hospitals in Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic, while Reporters Without Borders commissioned a museum within Minecraft promoting free speech.

Minecraft has over 150 million monthly users, but Roblox is the new market leader with 225 million monthly users and 75% of children ages 9-12 in the US using it regularly. Both games have over 6 billion hours of monthly usage and millions of user-designed in-game worlds. Roblox's most popular game, Adopt Me!, has been visited over 30 billion times and Roblox developers have received over $1 billion in payments. Fortnite also launched its own world-building mode and is transforming into a social platform. Travis Scott hosted a concert on Fortnite attended by 28 million players.

Travis Scott's concert on Fortnite had 28 million live players and premiered a track that debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts. The multi-decade history of social virtual worlds, from MUDs to Fortnite, has led to the recent emergence of the Metaverse. Tim Sweeney, CEO of Fortnite maker Epic Games, tweeted about the company's longstanding metaverse aspirations and the recent rapid advancement of working pieces. The arc of technological transformations shows that the mix of wireless speeds, devices, and applications needed for widespread adoption can take decades to achieve.

The proliferation of digital information services and cultural changes have been driven by generational succession. The success of platforms like Facebook and Roblox is due to the influence of technologies on consumers' thinking, in addition to enabling them. The growth of the metaverse is expected to lead to a fight for control.

Virtual worlds are expected to become more realistic and diverse, eventually leading to the realization of the Metaverse. There will be a fight for supremacy between tech giants and start-ups over hardware, technical standards, tools, content, digital wallets, and virtual identities. The winner could become more powerful than any government and be a god on earth. The internet's foundation was built through not-for-profit collectives focused on establishing open standards, allowing anyone to build a website and access it from any device or browser.

The openness of the internet, facilitated by common standards and open-source innovations, has enabled more companies to be built, reached more users, and achieved greater profits while preventing pre-internet giants from controlling it. This openness has also democratized information and prevented the internet from being controlled by multinational media conglomerates. Businesses can still make a profit and deploy proprietary technology, but the openness of the internet has benefited the entire ecosystem while preventing rent-seeking tendencies.

The openness of the internet prevented it from being controlled by corporations and democratized information. However, the Metaverse, which is being built by private businesses for commerce, data collection, and advertising, may not be as open. The Metaverse is emerging at a time when large tech platforms have established enormous influence over our lives and the modern economy, and the power they hold reflects profound feedback loops in the digital era. Metcalfe's Law may help keep the Metaverse open, but there are concerns that it may not be as open as the internet.

Large tech giants have closed much of the internet by bundling their services, preventing easy export of data, shutting down partner programs, and blocking potential competitors. The Metaverse presents a challenge as it will likely become a parallel plane of existence for millions of people, controlled by companies that will be more dominant than those in today's digital economy.

The Metaverse presents challenges related to data rights, security, misinformation, platform power, abuse, and user happiness. The philosophies, culture, and priorities of companies leading in the Metaverse era will determine the future. The Metaverse offers a chance to transform industries, build a more equal global economy, and bring people closer together. The Metaverse is poorly understood, and there is agency to reset the status quo. The article also includes a brief reference to a company's valuation being reduced and the mythological story of Pygmalion.

The concept of the Metaverse has no clear definition or consistent description, and industry leaders define it based on their worldviews and company capabilities. The film "The Matrix" has been compared to Jean Baudrillard's ideas, which he felt were misread in the film. In the Epic Games v. Apple case, Mr. Sweeney's beliefs about the future of the Metaverse were acknowledged. Microsoft and Facebook have their own interpretations of the Metaverse, with Microsoft's technology stack being a natural fit for it.

Facebook's Oculus division is the market leader in VR and social networking globally, while other companies like Epic and Match Group envision the Metaverse as a digitized communal space for self-expression and shared experiences. The definition of the Metaverse remains unclear, and some companies struggle to explain their place in it, particularly Chinese companies like NetEase competing with Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance.

NetEase is technologically ready for the Metaverse and aims to be one of the fastest runners in the space. CNBC's Jim Cramer struggled to explain the Metaverse to investors and compared it to the Holodeck from Star Trek.

The tech community debates whether augmented reality is part of the Metaverse and whether it can only be experienced through immersive VR headsets. The crypto and blockchain community views the Metaverse as a decentralized version of the internet, while some argue that a single company cannot operate the Metaverse. Facebook believes there can be only one Metaverse, while Microsoft and Roblox talk about Metaverses. The Metaverse is a virtual world where people compete in immersive VR games and act out their fantasies, as portrayed in Ernest Cline's Ready Player One.

The Metaverse, a virtual world that is similar to the internet in the 90s but in 3D, has been criticized for being a vague marketing hype and dystopian, and there are doubts about how it differs from previous virtual worlds like Second Life. Some speculate that big tech companies' interest in the Metaverse is an attempt to avoid regulatory action or that insurgent companies are using it to trigger antitrust investigations. Epic Games' lawsuit against Apple on antitrust grounds also mentioned how Apple's policies would prevent the emergence of the Metaverse.

Debates about the Metaverse are muddled, with some criticizing it as a vague marketing hype and others seeing it as an opportunity for widespread disruption. Some speculate that big tech companies are using it to avoid regulatory action or justify pet R&D projects, while others see it as a mechanism to challenge current policies and practices. The uncertainty and confusion surrounding the Metaverse are features of disruption, as seen in the early days of the internet.

The internet is a global network of various technologies that provide services such as email, web browsing, and file sharing. In the past, people had trouble understanding its potential and what technologies would succeed. Common errors include seeing emerging tech as trivial, misunderstanding its nature and potential, and getting the timing wrong. Even Nobel laureate Paul Krugman wrongly predicted that the internet's growth would slow drastically due to the flaw in Metcalfe's law, which stated that the number of connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants.

The significance of the internet was debated for over a decade after initial predictions were disproven. Even when the importance of the next platform is understood, its technical premises, related device roles, and business models can remain unclear. Microsoft misread the mobile market and made several mistakes, such as misjudging the dominant mobile form factor and the role of the device. This led to the company losing market share to competitors such as Apple.

Microsoft's mobile operating system failed due to competition from Apple's iOS and Google's Android. The absence of a keyboard made it unsuitable for business customers. Facebook initially misjudged the importance of apps and focused on browser-based experiences, but eventually shifted to native apps, which contributed to its success. Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook's biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5.

Facebook missed out on significant mobile ad revenue due to its delayed shift to native apps, with WhatsApp and Instagram now considered its most valuable assets. Other companies invested in fiber optic networks before there was a market to support it, resulting in underused infrastructure that now plays a vital role in the digital economy.

Bankruptcies of companies in the high-speed broadband industry were caused by multi-billion-dollar bets on rapid demand growth, while technological transformation is difficult to predict due to recursive innovation. Predictions for internet usage tend to be vague, and few imagined the rise of communication through emojis and social media, as well as the impact of Reddit and Robinhood on investing strategies.

Technological transformation is difficult to predict, as demonstrated by past failures to predict the widespread use of computers and the dominance of social media. The arrival of the Metaverse is similarly uncertain, but focusing on the specific technologies and features that comprise it is key to preparing for its disruptive force. Virtual reality applications are defined as computer-generated simulations of three-dimensional objects or environments with physical user interaction, with immersive virtual reality referring to full sensory immersion in the environment. Defining the Metaverse is important for understanding its potential impact.

The Metaverse is a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence and continuity of data. It differs from today's internet and is based on virtual worlds that can be immersive, 2D, or text-based. The users can affect and be affected by the virtual world through different devices. The chapter explains each element of the definition and when the Metaverse might be achieved.

Virtual worlds can reproduce the real world or represent a fictionalized or altogether fictional reality with game-like or non-game-like objectives. Most of the growth in virtual worlds has been in those without game-like objectives, exemplified by the best-selling game Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which has no explicit goals. Recently, there has been an uptick in virtual worlds without gameplay, such as the digital twin of Hong Kong International Airport.

Virtual worlds created using popular game engines like Unity can simulate real-world scenarios such as airport operations or city management. They enable planners to make informed decisions about zoning, construction approvals, and more. The popularity of virtual worlds has surged due to their accessibility and diversity, with some amateur creations having millions of players. Virtual worlds can be fully persistent, reset for each player, or somewhere in between.

Virtual worlds like Super Mario Bros. have varying degrees of persistence and data retention. Some virtual worlds are limited to specific devices or platforms, while others are fully cross-platform. The governance models of virtual worlds vary greatly, with most being centrally controlled by the developer.

The Metaverse is a virtual world that relies on blockchain technology and 3D environments. 3D is necessary to facilitate the transition of human culture and labor from the physical world to the digital one. The nature of online communities has evolved from text-based to the use of personal websites and social networks, and now to new forms of online socializing. Some blockchain-based games aim to operate autonomously, while users in other instances self-govern through various forms of democracy.

Users express themselves through high-resolution photos and videos on social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. The internet is becoming more real, and as a result, more of our real lives are lived online. New social apps, embraced by younger generations, are typically the leading indicator for change. A 3D internet could disrupt industries that have resisted digital disruption, such as education. Despite predictions that online schooling would partly displace traditional, in-person education, the cost of traditional education continues to rise, and prestigious schools have not launched remote education programs that match the quality of their in-person equivalent. The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the need for better online education options.



Improvements in 3D virtual worlds and simulations, VR and AR headsets are expected to reshape pedagogical practices, allowing students to engage in interactive and immersive learning experiences. 

The Metaverse is a 3D experience, but not everything inside it will be in 3D. Many people will continue to use 2D games and interfaces. 

The advent of the 3D Metaverse does not mean that the entirety of the internet and computing will transition to 3D. 

Immersive VR is just one way to access the Metaverse, and it is not a requirement.



Mobile data networks and mobile content can be accessed without a screen, as demonstrated by machine-to-machine and IoT devices and sensors. 

Real-Time Rendering involves using computer programs to generate 2D or 3D objects or environments, and the resources available determine the complexity and level of detail. 

Pixar built a data center of 2,000 conjoined industrial-grade computers with a combined 24,000 cores to render frames for Monsters University in seven seconds. 

Many companies need to wait longer to render highly detailed models, but prioritizing visual fidelity may not be necessary for all applications.

Real-time rendering is essential for virtual worlds to allow for immersive environments and user agency. Pre-rendered images limit functionality and choice. Real-time rendering requires a minimum of 30 to 120 frames per second and intensive computing power. Interoperability is crucial for users to take their virtual content from one virtual world to another.

The Metaverse should allow for interoperability between virtual worlds, enabling users to take their virtual content and achievements across platforms. Interoperability requires computer systems or software to exchange information. The internet is an example of successful interoperability. The establishment of TCP/IP and voluntary adoption by computer networks globally enabled the internet's success.



 The Internet Protocol Suite was embraced and new working bodies were established to ensure interoperability of the internet and World Wide Web. 

 Common standards were established for files, presenting information on the internet, and browser engines that could render this information. 

 Competing standards were established, but technical solutions emerged to convert between them. 

 The openness of the early web led to most alternatives being open sourced and seeking broad compatibility. 

 The internet demonstrates the systems, technical standards, and conventions required to establish, maintain, and scale interoperability across heterogenous applications, networks, devices, operating systems, languages, domains, countries, and more. 

 Virtual worlds today use their own rendering engines and save data in different formats, posing challenges for interoperability.



 Existing virtual worlds lack systems to share data with other virtual worlds, resulting in isolation and fragmentation. 

 Virtual worlds were not designed to be interoperable, but instead to be closed experiences with controlled economies. 

 Establishing standards and solutions for interoperability is a complex and challenging task, even for relatively simple objects like avatars. 

 The definition and composition of avatars are complex questions, including how many articles of clothing they wear and which parts can be recolored together. 

 Users expect different types of avatars to move in different ways, and objects like tattoos and necklaces should interact with avatars differently based on their movement.

Developers need to agree on standards for virtual goods to properly interpret, modify, and approve third-party virtual goods. Challenges include ensuring virtual goods make sense in different virtual worlds, managing ownership records, and monetization. Interoperable identifies, digital communications, and payments also pose unique challenges. Standards need to be highly efficient, and the example of GIF vs. MP4 highlights the importance of selecting efficient standards.

The use of inefficient standards like GIF may lead to extra bandwidth use and worse experiences in the Metaverse. Standardization is a complicated and messy process that requires consensus and often results in forks. Some argue that competing networks of virtual worlds may emerge instead of a single Metaverse. However, the value of a single integrated internet is obvious in hindsight.

The establishment of common standards is key to driving interoperability in the Metaverse economy, which will attract more users and developers, leading to better experiences and driving greater investment. Massively scaled virtual worlds are necessary for the Metaverse to truly exist and compete with the outside world. The leaders who establish interoperability standards will have significant influence over the rules and updates of the Metaverse.

The Metaverse is a virtual universe that includes multiple interconnected virtual worlds, with a unifying layer that sits above them all. It includes metagalaxies, which are collections of virtual worlds that operate under a single authority and are connected by a visual layer. Roblox is an example of a metagalaxy, while Adopt Me! is a virtual world within it. The Metaverse may have limitations on interoperability due to social, economic, cultural, and safety factors.



 Tim Sweeney believes that every company will eventually need to operate their own virtual worlds. 

 Most current virtual worlds do not demonstrate full persistence, as they reset after a finite period. 

 World of Warcraft runs continuously but still does not fully persist as the consequences of player choices or events do not endure indefinitely. 

 The only thing that persists in virtual worlds is the players themselves.



 Persistence in virtual worlds is the challenge of deciding which information to retain, render, and share with others, as it affects computational needs and memory usage. 

 The game EVE Online is an example of a persistently operating virtual world with a shared space spanning thousands of star systems and planets. 

 The virtual world of EVE Online is designed with an innovative systems architecture and creative design, with empty three-dimensional space and galaxy wallpaper backgrounds.

EVE Online is a massively multiplayer online game where players conquer planets, systems, and galaxies through the establishment of corporations, formation of alliances, and strategic positioning of fleets. The game's persistence is mostly about managing entitlements and related locational data, which means less computational work for CCP Games servers and users' devices. The game is technically and sociologically complex, but limited compared to most visions of the Metaverse. Large-scale battles are rare, and the game mostly takes place in the real world via third-party messaging applications and emails.

The literal version of the Metaverse imagined by Stephenson, where users persist forever and individual items wear with use, is far beyond anything possible today. Most participants would rather teleport from destination to destination, rather than navigating through a single unifying layer for everything in the virtual world. It is easier to manage the persistence of a user's data across various worlds and time, and this model closely reflects the internet as it exists today. The internet persists irrespective of any one site, platform, or top-level domain.

For virtual worlds to become meaningful spaces for human society, persistence of virtual goods, history, and achievements is necessary. Virtual identity is based on continuity of memory, but currently, virtual worlds lack persistence. Increasing persistence within individual virtual worlds will be essential for the growth of the Metaverse. Virtual real estate and physical spaces are likely to be the most in need of persistence. Additionally, synchronous shared experiences are crucial for virtual worlds to be successful, requiring reliable internet connections for all participants.

To create a successful Metaverse, a sustained, uninterrupted, low latency, and high bandwidth internet connection is crucial for synchronous shared experiences. However, the current internet was not designed for synchronous shared experiences but for sharing static copies of messages and files. Although internet outages have become less common, continuous connectivity is still a significant constraint. Most online experiences today work well because they only require frequently updated pages, rather than continuous connectivity.

The delivery of data packets in internet-based services, including video streaming and instant messaging, is not a live and continuous connection but rather a batch of one-way, non-live data packets. Netflix uses machine learning algorithms to compress video file sizes and pre-load content at local nodes for faster delivery. The delivery feels continuous, but it is not actually continuous.

Online experiences require different levels of bandwidth, latency, and connectivity. Live video streams are less reliable than on-demand streams due to their synchronous nature. Live streamers use delayed transmission and commercial breaks to ensure reliability. High-frequency stock traders require low delivery times but don't need continuous server connections. Videoconferencing software requires high-resolution video files and shared experiences but doesn't work for real-time rendered virtual worlds.

In videoconferencing, participants may experience connectivity issues, but the call can usually continue without disruption. Zoom can send missed packets and prioritize audio over video in case of network congestion. Virtual worlds have higher performance requirements and are more affected by connectivity issues.

In virtual worlds, even slight connectivity issues can disrupt the entire collective experience and result in conflicting versions of the world. Lag can lead to invalid experiences and disconnections may prevent rejoining a session. This poses a risk to individuals and frustrates the collective experience. Real-time rendered virtual worlds are still inaccessible to some American households.

The challenge of synchronicity is critical to the evolution of the Metaverse, and networking capabilities will define and constrain much of what is possible. There are no simple, inexpensive, or quick solutions, and new infrastructure, wireless standards, and hardware equipment may be required. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a challenge because it was designed for sharing static, asynchronous files and follows a standardized methodology for routing traffic. BGP may need to be revised for the Metaverse to function optimally, but any changes depend on opt-in from thousands of internet service providers.

Stephenson's Metaverse in Snow Crash was occupied by twice the population of New York City and accessible to 120 million people with powerful computers. In reality, even nonpersistent virtual worlds operated by successful video game companies struggle to sustain more than 50 to 150 users in a shared simulation. Fortnite's social experiences and 2020 concert with Travis Scott are limited by technical constraints, and globally scaling the Metaverse will require substantial updates and opt-in from multiple providers.

The article discusses the challenges of handling large numbers of concurrent users in online games such as Fortnite, World of Warcraft, and EVE Online. To cope with these challenges, these games implement various design choices such as limiting the number of players per instance, disabling certain features, creating multiple copies of areas, and restricting interactions between players in different realms. EVE Online is unique in that it features a single, persistent realm for all players, but this is made possible by the simplicity of its gameplay mechanics, which rely more on player decision-making than on complex animations and interactions.

The article discusses how EVE Online handles concurrency challenges by designing its gameplay mechanics around space travel and strategic costs/risk, and by treating users as being in separate virtual worlds until necessary. However, the game still experiences concurrency issues, as demonstrated by the Yulai Problem and the largest battle in EVE's history in January 2021, which overwhelmed CCP Games servers and caused many players to be unable to enter the system. These challenges continue to inform the game's design and expansion.

Concurrency is a foundational problem for the Metaverse as it leads to exponential increases in data processing, rendering, and synchronization. The Metaverse can only become a reality if it can support a large number of users experiencing the same event, at the same time, and in the same place without making substantial concessions in user functionality, world interactivity, persistence, and rendering quality. However, we are far from being able to replicate the density and flexibility of the real world, and it is likely to remain impossible for some time.

The Metaverse is at least five to ten years away with serious optimization tradeoffs. The definition of the Metaverse is a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users. This definition does not directly require decentralization, Web3, or blockchain. The terms decentralization, Web3, and blockchain have become entangled with the Metaverse, but they have different definitions and are not directly required for the Metaverse.

The Metaverse and Web3 are likely to arise together, as technological transitions often lead to societal change and new companies emerging. The principles of Web3 are critical to establishing a thriving Metaverse, and competition is important for its success. The Metaverse will be built by independent users, developers, and small-to-medium businesses, rather than megacorporations. Trust is a key consideration for the health and prospects of the Metaverse, and Web3 advocates argue that virtual entitlements are a façade under centralized database and server models.

Centralized servers do not prevent considerable user spending on virtual items, but reliance on trillion-dollar platforms can constrain this spending. This dynamic is particularly problematic for developers who must build virtual stores and businesses despite the inability to guarantee their operation in the future. Legal systems may eventually be updated to provide users and developers with greater authority over their wares, data, and investment, but decentralization makes the reliance on court orders unnecessary. Some believe that only a decentralized network of individually owned and compensated servers and devices can provide the computing resources needed for the Metaverse. The article also mentions Epic Games suing Apple, and the technique of skeuomorphism in graphical design.

The Metaverse is seen as a successor to the mobile internet and will require the development of new standards, infrastructure, and devices, potentially leading to a transformation of the balance of power between technology giants, independent developers, and end-users. Companies are repositioning themselves in expectation of the Metaverse's arrival, despite it remaining far off and its effects being largely unclear. The emergence of new computing and networking platforms has historically changed the world and the companies that lead it.

Generational changes in computing and networking platforms often disrupt established categories, with new entrants displacing old leaders. Examples include the rise of iOS and Android in the mobile era and the emergence of chat services such as AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ, Skype, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Slack. These players offered services predicated upon different usage behaviors, needs, and communication styles, and built tools with programmatic integration into various productivity tools and online services.

The payments space rapidly changed in the late 1990s with the emergence of peer-to-peer digital payment networks like PayPal. The Metaverse, seen as the next-generation internet, has precursors in platforms and operating systems like virtual world platforms and real-time rendering engines. Blockchain/cryptocurrency networks are seen as foundational enablers of the Metaverse. The Metaverse is not a single company but a network of networks operating independently, with different technical stacks, but sharing common standards and protocols.

The establishment of the Metaverse will be similar to that of the internet, with many groups trying to build or co-opt it, but it will likely be produced through the partial integration of many competing virtual world platforms and technologies. The Metaverse will evolve to build on top of the internet's underlying architecture or protocol suite in a distinctive way. Despite significant technical limitations, this process will take time and will not replace or fundamentally alter the internet's architecture. The mobile internet era is distinct from the predominantly fixed-line internet era of the past, and the internet is a bundle of many different things, accessed through various devices using different chipsets that communicate using common standards and protocols.

The internet comprises various standards and protocols, and no single company can improve it alone. The gaming industry, despite being a late adopter of the internet, is well-positioned to drive the development of the Metaverse due to constraints driving technical development. Gaming's $180 billion industry is poised to alter the $95 trillion world economy.

The internet and mobile industries initially had limited capabilities due to technical constraints, but they were still valuable to businesses. Video games, however, were not constrained by the same limitations and were primarily responsible for driving advancements in computer processing power. Video game consoles and gaming-focused PCs have historically been the most technically capable devices owned by households and small businesses.

Video game technology has advanced to the point where it is being used in supercomputers for complex tasks such as radar enhancement, pattern recognition, and AI research. Companies like Nvidia, originally focused on video games, have become some of the most powerful technology companies in the world due to the demanding and large market of gaming. Nvidia's CEO believes that the market for powerful computing is usually very small, making gaming an ideal strategic decision for the development of necessary technologies.

The emergence of the Metaverse via gaming is something author Neal Stephenson missed in his seminal novel Snow Crash, as he was focused on the market mechanism for affordable 3D graphics hardware. However, video games have driven down the cost of 3D graphics hardware and are the best solutions for real-time 3D rendering. Game developers, publishers, and platforms have had to work around the challenges of networking, giving them an advantage in developing the Metaverse.

Game developers have unique expertise in creating synchronous and continuous networking connections, which will be crucial for the Metaverse. They have been using predictive AI, custom software, and aligning gameplay with technical challenges for decades. Additionally, they possess the ability to create immersive virtual environments that people would want to spend time in. As the Metaverse era involves the use of bits to produce 3D virtual worlds, game developers' experience in creating virtual atoms will be essential. Stephenson's Snow Crash predicted people going to bars on the Street, but what we have now are Warcraft guilds going on in-game raids.

The text discusses the importance of the Metaverse and outlines what it will take to make it a reality. It introduces a workable definition of the Metaverse and explains why video game makers are at its forefront. It also briefly mentions Samsung's role in the mobile device market and the regionalization of the internet due to regulatory enforcement. The text then delves into the philosophical idea of whether a falling tree makes a sound and the various interpretations of the concept of sound.

The article discusses the concept of existence in the context of the Metaverse, which is a virtual world that may become a reality in the future. It explains the requirements for building the Metaverse, including networking, computing, game engines, platforms, and standards. The article compares the existence of the Metaverse and its contents to Berkeley's tree, which is a philosophical concept that questions the nature of existence. The article concludes that the Metaverse and its contents will only exist as data stored in servers and that different technologies and steps are required for it to exist beyond that. It also discusses the challenges of simulating complex natural phenomena in the Metaverse, such as the fall of a tree.

The article discusses Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) as a technically impressive virtual world that simulates airplane travel. It explains the history and development of the franchise, noting that MSFS is not a traditional game with a competitive goal, but rather a simulator that replicates the experience of flying a plane. The article emphasizes the bandwidth requirements and technical constraints of simulating such an experience in a virtual world, and notes the critical reception MSFS has received as a new way of understanding the digital world.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is an extraordinary, realistic and expansive consumer-grade simulation with over 500,000,000 square kilometers of map area, including 1.5 billion buildings and nearly every road, mountain, city, and airport across the world. It is based on high-quality scans and images of the real world, making it difficult to distinguish between a screenshot from MSFS and a real-world photograph. Its virtual world is nearly 2.5 petabytes large, making it impractical to store on most consumer devices, and it updates to reflect real-world weather, air traffic, and geographic changes.

Microsoft Flight Simulator stores a small portion of the game on a consumer's device, roughly 150 GB, which is enough to run the game offline but with mostly procedurally generated environments and objects. To experience the game's wonder, players need to go online as Microsoft's servers stream new maps, textures, weather data, flight paths, and other information. Unlike other online games, MSFS sends as little information as possible when playing, revealing new information as players explore the virtual world.

Online games require large files for game logic and assets, but online play involves only a small amount of downloaded data per hour. Online multiplayer servers send positional data and other information during gameplay. Most online games remain mostly offline because the internet is not reliable. This approach imposes limitations but works well for games.

Games must store all assets, textures, and models in advance for rendering. Aspiring for greater diversity of virtual objects and live movements, a vast amount of data cannot be sent in advance, requiring downloads for updates. A central server sends a specific version of the virtual world to all users, limiting its "aliveness."

The Metaverse is not as seamless as many imagine, with limitations to where users can go and long loading times between virtual worlds. Epic had to send users each mini-world days before Travis Scott's concert on Fortnite, and each set piece was loaded in the background. The most Metaverse-like virtual worlds use a hybrid local/cloud streaming data model. This approach is critical for games like Roblox and MSFS due to their large item and environmental diversity.

The current internet infrastructure can only handle Metaverse-style live data streaming in a highly constrained fashion. Roblox doesn't need to cloud stream much data because most in-game items are pre-fabs, while MSFS needs nearly 25 times as much hourly bandwidth as Fortnite and five times as much as Roblox due to its high graphical fidelity. However, MSFS doesn't need the data particularly fast and the consequences of delayed data are modest. MSFS's virtual world has more in common with a diorama than the Metaverse.

Real-time rendered virtual worlds require high amounts of data and low latency for a continuous connection. Bandwidth and latency are often conflated but are distinct concepts. Bandwidth is like the number of lanes on a highway while latency is like the speed limit. Ultra-low latency is not necessary for most online services, but it is critical for virtual worlds. Meeting the challenge of providing a global road system that sustains low latency is a substantial challenge.

For most online services, ultra-low latency is not critical. However, for interactive experiences like gaming, even small amounts of latency can be frustrating. The human threshold for latency is low, with delays as short as 50 ms causing frustration for avid gamers. Synchronization issues in audio and video are only noticeable if they exceed 45 ms early or 125 ms late. With digital buttons, response times longer than 200 to 250 ms can make users feel that their click failed. In the United States, the median time for data latency is around 60 ms, which is sufficient for most online services but may not meet the demands of real-time rendered virtual worlds.

The transit time between cities for data is 35ms, but city-to-user transit time is prone to slowdowns due to congestion and limited bandwidth of copper cabling. Round-trip delivery times in the US are generally acceptable, but connections suffer from jitter that can frequently spike due to congestion somewhere along the network path. The online gaming industry has developed solutions such as match-making around server regions to minimize latency within each region.

Multiplayer online games use netcode solutions like delay-based and rollback netcode to ensure synchronization and consistency. However, these workarounds are not always effective for sandbox-style virtual worlds with cloud-streamed data and dozens of players. Only three-quarters of American broadband homes can consistently participate in high-fidelity real-time virtual worlds, and an average 10 ms increase or decrease in latency can reduce or increase weekly playtime by 6%.

The Metaverse will require low latency for social interactions, as even slight delays can be eerie and affect human conversation. While this may not be an issue for some asynchronous games, synchronous games require precise inputs and low latency. Latency and bandwidth affect the amount of data that can be sent, and communication often spans the entire globe. Median delivery times between continents can be as much as 350-400 ms or even longer. The revenue implications for the gaming industry due to latency are considerable, and almost no other type of business faces such sensitivity.

Latency is a major obstacle in the development of the Metaverse due to its impact on social interactions, synchronization challenges, and the physics of networking. Augmented reality-based experiences have particularly stringent requirements for latency, and every additional user compounds synchronization challenges. Investment in lower latency internet infrastructure will increase as the Metaverse grows, but the laws of physics present a constant battle with the speed of light, making it difficult to achieve ultra-low latency levels. The average latency of a packet sent between US and Asia data centers is 230 ms, far short of the 40-45 ms benchmark for competitive video games.

Data sent through fiber optic cables doesn't travel in a straight line due to the refraction of light in glass fibers, causing a nearly 31% elongation of the route. International internet infrastructure is easier to improve than domestic internet infrastructure due to various obstacles such as transportation infrastructure, population centers, and protected lands. Many countries and cities lack direct connections due to international rights, geographic impediments, and cost/benefit analyses. The global internet relies on nearly 500 submarine cables and 1,250 landing stations.

The internet backbone is a loose federation of private networks that were not laid out to be nationally efficient. Private network operators often piggyback on existing infrastructure, resulting in data being carried by several different networks (hops) between two cities. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) helps networks determine which other network to route data through, prioritizing cost over distance. As a result, many routes are far longer than necessary, causing inconsistent transit times for data packets.

The delivery time for data packets traveling across long distances is slowed by various factors including physical infrastructure limitations and government approvals for upgrades. Upgrading wireless infrastructure, such as 5G networks, offers some improvement but it only helps with the last few hundred meters of data transmission. Satellite internet, like Starlink, promises high-bandwidth but does not achieve ultra-low latency especially at great distances.

Satellite internet exacerbates the problem of travel distances due to increased latency and atmospheric interference. It enables harder-to-serve customers to meet minimum latency specifications for the Metaverse but does not offer improvements for those who already meet it. Central processing units and graphics processing units play a crucial role in operating a synchronized virtual world, and there have been significant increases in computing resources available and manufactured per year. Nonetheless, bandwidth and latency limitations will continue to constrain the Metaverse and everything in it in the near future.

Computing resources have always been scarce as we tend to perform more complicated calculations when more capability is available. The growth in the size of video game consoles over the years is mostly due to the decision to place more computing power and larger fans to cool it. Pixar uses its computing power to create more sophisticated renders and reduce the time it takes to render frames. They have reduced the time to render a shot in Coco from over 1000 hours to 55 hours by baking a number of lights.

The renders and calculations required for the Metaverse must be created every ~0.016 or ~0.0083 seconds and are far more complicated than what even the most impressive virtual worlds today are capable of. Virtual worlds with hundreds of even thousands of concurrent users have been possible since the late 1990s but users and the virtual worlds were severely constrained. Engaging in these experiences required a player to buy a dedicated gaming PC, which could run into the thousands of dollars.

The development of consumer-grade devices and affordable servers in the mid-2010s led to the growth of high CCU (concurrent user) games with rich user-generated content. These games quickly expanded into virtual events and experiences, leading to enormous growth in the gaming industry. Today, over 350 million people participate in battle royale games every day, and games like Roblox have over 225 million monthly users. Design decisions, such as scattering players across large maps, help these games work around current computation constraints.

While high CCU games like battle royales use tricks to work around computation constraints, limitations still exist, especially for devices with lower processing power. Devices that are a few years old may have to make compromises, such as not loading custom outfits. Games also limit what users can do in more confined spaces, such as virtual concert venues. Computing capabilities improve every year, but the limitations of devices in certain regions still impact game design and functionality.

The Metaverse will require significant computing power to create immersive simulations with full motion capture, custom virtual items, and rich modifications. Adding physics laws to the virtual world may seem excessive, but computing power limitations will shape the Metaverse experiences that are possible. The amount of computing power required for the Metaverse remains unclear, but it is a moral imperative to build it.

The Metaverse requires a significant increase in computational efficiency, up to 1000 times the current state of the art, and is still at least 5 to 10 years away. One argument suggests performing as much work as possible in remote data centers rather than consumer devices, to avoid wasteful duplication of work. The server of the virtual world owner would only track user inputs and relay them to players' devices, which would process and act on the information.

In online games, variations in device latency can lead to different outcomes for players. This creates limitations, such as a lower-end device limiting the complexity of the virtual world for all players. To overcome these limitations, industrial-grade data centers could process and render more of the game, enabling a more consistent and complex experience for all players.

Cloud-based gaming services like Google Stadia and Amazon Luna process video gameplay in remote data centers and stream the rendered experience to users' devices, eliminating the need for expensive hardware upgrades. However, the debate over whether to rely on remote data centers or local computing performance continues, with concerns about latency and network constraints.

Sending large amounts of data in real-time for remote-rendered experiences is still a challenge due to limited power, despite minimal data being sent. Remote compute has yet to prove more efficient for rendering because GPUs render only what is necessary for a user at a given point using techniques like viewing-frustrum culling, occlusion, and level of detail. This means that other users cannot piggyback off one player's GPU, and simultaneous renders are not the same as supporting multiple users.

Each player's device processor can only handle a finite amount of information, and random-access memory stores renders for reuse rather than rendering from scratch each time. Resolution and frame rate drop as more players join a game. A GPU cannot efficiently render two different games at once and cannot divide its power across multiple users like a power plant or CPU server. There is currently no inherent efficiency in designing mega GPUs, and many companies are working on the problem.

Cloud gaming services face challenges with GPU capacity and utilization rates. GPUs become more expensive per unit of power as their capacity increases, and splitting or sharing GPUs is difficult. Microsoft's cloud game streaming servers use de-shelled Xboxes to serve each player, rather than bespoke hardware, which would require games to support an additional type of Xbox. Data center economics optimize for demand, so renting high-end GPUs with low utilization rates is expensive. Amazon Web Services offers reduced rates for reserved instances but spot instances may not be available or may only have lower-end GPUs. Solving the computing shortage cannot rely solely on using remote servers.

Consolidating servers into fewer locations can improve cost models by increasing average utilization rates. However, this increases the distance between remote GPUs and the end user, resulting in higher latency. Shifting computing resources to the cloud incurs new costs such as equipment servicing, security, and management, as well as higher bandwidth costs for high-resolution, high-frame-rate content. Improvements in local compute are likely to outpace improvements in network bandwidth, latency, and reliability. While Moore's Law may be slowing down, CPU and GPU processing power continues to grow at a rapid pace, and consumers frequently replace their primary computing device, resulting in significant improvements for end-user compute every two to three years.

Decentralized computing involves utilizing the processing power of mostly idle devices in homes and nearby industrial server farms. The idea of collectively sharing but privately owned infrastructure is well-understood culturally. Distributed computing programs have been around since the 1990s. Blockchains could provide the technological mechanism and economic model for decentralized computing, allowing owners of underutilized CPUs and GPUs to be paid in cryptocurrency for the use of their processing capabilities. There may even be a live auction for access to these resources.

A capacity bidding marketplace could provide the required processing capacity for the Metaverse by allowing accounts to bid out computing tasks to nearby, unused devices. Proponents see this as an inevitable feature of all future microchips, with every computer designed to auction off spare cycles at all times. Virtual world engines rely on data and code to render virtual experiences. Neal Stephenson explored this technology and experience in his book Cryptonomicon.

The virtual world requires code to process data and interact with objects, while the real world operates on preprogrammed laws of physics. In a game, interactions require a lot of data and code, whereas in the real world, the laws of physics take care of the results. More complicated interactions in a virtual world require more data and a more comprehensive logic.

Virtual worlds benefit from not having to create infinite permutations that have limited practical value to their games. This approach introduces obstacles to building interoperable Metaverse-like virtual worlds. Developers constantly rebuild everything from a football field to a football, making it harder every year as virtual world builders take advantage of more sophisticated CPUs and GPUs. The average number of staff credits and budgets for open-world action games has grown significantly over the years.

The Metaverse requires vast amounts of data and code handled by programmers. Game engines are crucial to the Metaverse as they establish the virtual laws and rules of interaction. Unity and Unreal Engine are popular game engines, but building one's own engine is still preferred by some developers. Fees and concerns about reliance on another company's pipelines and priorities are factors to consider when choosing a game engine.

Large publishers typically build their own game engines, while smaller or inexperienced teams often choose to license and customize Unreal or Unity engines. This allows them to focus on creative work and appeal to experienced developers, as well as integrate third-party tools easily. Game engines are analogous to designing and building a house, but games need to run on multiple devices and operating systems, which presents a challenge.

Independent game engines and live services suites, such as Unity, Unreal, PlayFab, and GameSparks, provide cross-platform and cross-developer technologies that benefit the entire gaming industry by allowing developers to concentrate on core game logic. These solutions include user account systems, player data storage, in-game transactions, matchmaking, analytics, anti-cheat systems, and more. As the global economy continues to shift towards virtual worlds, these technologies will become a core part of global society and will likely be used by non-game entities such as retailers, schools, sports teams, construction companies, and cities.

GameSparks, along with other independent game engines and live services suites, have become a standard feature in the virtual world, serving as a lingua franca for the Metaverse. Integrated virtual world platforms (IVWPs) such as Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite Creative have emerged as a new approach, which uses graphical interfaces instead of coding to build games, experiences, and virtual worlds. The IVWP interface enables users to create more easily and with fewer people and investment.

Roblox is a platform for building virtual worlds that is accessible to nearly 10 million users, many of whom are children. Virtual worlds on Roblox must use the platform's entire suite of live services and are accessed through a unified experiential layer. Roblox operates an integrated marketplace for developers to upload custom-made items and license them to other game makers. Building an IVWP is harder than building a game engine because everything is a priority and the platform wants to maximize interconnectivity while standardizing underlying technologies.

Virtual worlds built on platforms like Second Life and Roblox face challenges with functionality, errors, and bugs that can disrupt the economy and create distrust in the market. However, the potential of virtual worlds built on programming is nearly boundless, as everything can be endlessly repurposed or improved upon. The collaborative nature of an IVWP network allows for continual improvements, which can attract more users and increase revenue, leading to further investments and improvements.

Roblox's engagement has been rapidly increasing, with more than 4 billion hours of usage per month and popular games played 15 to 30 billion times each. All top games come from independent developers with little prior experience. Roblox's userbase has grown from 76 million to over 226 million, and revenues have increased 469% from Q4 2018 to Q4 2021.

Roblox's payments to developers have grown 660%, with older audiences making up a larger proportion of users. The company has invested heavily in R&D, spending more in Q4 2021 than it generated in revenue in Q1 2020, with projected R&D spending of $750 million in 2022 and potentially reaching $1 billion. This investment is in contrast to games like Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2, which were among the most expensive productions ever.

Roblox invests heavily in its platform with an R&D budget of $750 million, which is more than Sony's PlayStation group and other game engines. Its investments are diverse and span across several areas such as developer tools, server architecture, machine learning, virtual reality, and motion capture. Roblox's investments enable developers to produce more compelling virtual worlds, which leads to more revenue and drives more user engagement and spending on the platform. Although Roblox is not entirely a metaverse, it comes close to the definition with its massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds.

Roblox is a Metagalaxy, not a Metaverse, as most virtual worlds will exist outside of it. While it's possible for companies to subsume all virtual experiences and become a Metaverse-sized Metagalaxy, the number of virtual experiences, innovators, technologies, opportunities, and developers are growing faster than these virtual giants. Roblox and Minecraft are still at the early stages of virtual worlds, and their reach is modest compared to the global internet population. Minecraft had ceded its crown to Roblox, which has nearly twice the daily users as Minecraft had monthly.



Various Interactive Virtual Worlds Platforms (IVWPs) have been launched, including Fortnite, Free Fire, and Grand Theft Auto V. 

The success of Roblox, Minecraft, and FNC will likely inspire more IVWPs to come to market. 

Companies like Krafton and Riot Games are developing their own IVWPs, and many new ones are being developed around different technical premises. 

Blockchain-based IVWPs, such as Decentraland and The Sandbox, aim to grow quickly by giving users more ownership over in-world items, a say in governance, and a right to share in profitability. 

Facebook's Horizon Worlds is focused on immersive VR and AR, while Roblox prioritizes traditional screen interfaces.



Platforms like VRChat and Rec Room are centered on immersive VR world creation and are accumulating users, with valuations around $1-3 billion each. 

Niantic is working on its own augmented reality and location-based virtual world platforms. 

Facebook's history of launching and copying successful services shows that competitors to current market leaders may grow alongside and potentially displace them. 

Although top integrated virtual world platforms are fast-growing, they also face competition and potential disruption from emerging competitors.

Roblox, Minecraft, and FNC generate a small fraction of gaming revenues and have fewer players compared to major cross-platform engines like Unity and Unreal. The number of professional developers using these IVWPs is estimated to be in the tens of thousands, while millions of active and skilled developers use Unity and Unreal. The growing value of virtual worlds and the Metaverse increases the incentives for a developer to in-source their technology stack. However, many developers still use Unreal or Unity as a game engine, or GameSparks or PlayFab for live services.

Building standalone virtual worlds is cheaper and more profitable than creating them inside IVWPs. Games and game engines are not the only components of the Metaverse. Other categories have their own rendering and simulation software, including Autodesks AutoCAD, Dassault Systmes CATIA and SolidWorks, and Pixar's Renderman solutions. Unity and Unreal have also made inroads into non-gaming categories, such as engineering, filmmaking, and computer-aided design. Game engines can make it easier to produce a Metaverse that spans both the physical and virtual planes of existence.

The virtual software market is growing rapidly, with established companies like Autodesk and Dassault adding simulation functionality, and new companies emerging to customize game engines for architects and engineers. Disney's Industrial Light & Magic has developed its own rendering engine, and virtual software that scans the real world, such as Matterport and Planet Labs, is also growing quickly. These software platforms create 3D models of building interiors and can be used for various applications, including real estate, smart homes, and more.

Planet Labs captures high-resolution imagery of the entire Earth via satellite each day, and its goal is to make the entire planet legible to software. The virtual world market is likely to have many platforms and underlying technology providers, rather than a single company controlling the entire metaverse. The power and influence of the big five technology companies is already a concern, and the shift to the metaverse raises questions about who will control the second plane of human existence.

The evolution of the Metaverse should not be tied to the investments and beliefs of a single platform, and interoperability is necessary. The existence of a virtual tree can be harder to ascertain than a real one. Compatibility with most gaming platforms does not guarantee that a given experience can run on them, and Epic Games' history with Fortnite demonstrates this concern. Epic Games has launched its own publishing arm to release games made.

Interoperability in the Metaverse is complicated by the fact that virtual assets do not physically exist and there are many different file formats and rendering engines. Unlike physical goods, virtual goods require active admission and understanding by the receiving system. The lack of a universal standard for virtual objects further complicates interoperability. Epic Games' launch of its own publishing arm places the company in greater competition with publishers that occasionally licensed Unreal.

The standardization of online languages and media was due to the late entry of for-profit businesses to the internet. However, the gaming industry, which emerged in the 1950s, had to pioneer computer-based content without any existing standards. This resulted in diverse technical requirements and file formats for different applications, from 2D and 3D games to AR and VR experiences. Full standardization may underserve some applications while falling massively short on others. The challenge of standardization goes beyond file formats and includes ontological questions, particularly in 3D.

The challenge of defining interactive objects in the Metaverse is far harder than agreeing on 2D images. Avatars require detailed coding for attributes such as motion and appropriateness for different applications. Technical standards, conventions, and systems are necessary for interoperability, but the challenge extends to the issue of copying virtual goods without losing their value. Without a solution, infinite copies of shared virtual goods will exist, compromising their tradeability.

Managing ownership of virtual goods in video games is complex and requires systems to track, validate, and modify ownership rights, as well as safely share data between partners. This includes addressing issues such as managing an economy of interoperable virtual objects, fixing prices, limiting what can be sold or traded, and restricting cashing out into real-world currency. These considerations have financial implications, but publishers must also balance them with the need to create fun and engaging games.

The gaming industry faces challenges in achieving interoperability of virtual goods and currencies, which requires common standards and secure data-sharing models. Publishers fear competition and a lack of financial value in a virtual goods marketplace, and the goal of achieving interoperability requires nuance. While most apparel is interoperable in the real world, not all virtual goods can be easily interchanged, and technical concessions are necessary. A level playing field for competition and a focus on making games better and more appealing are important considerations for publishers.

There are many different technical and cultural standards that vary globally, including measurements, clothing, currencies, and forms of identification. Not all businesses, locations, or systems accept the same standards, and some may require specific adaptations or replacements. The internet and the Metaverse also have varying levels of interoperability and compatibility.

The success of the Metaverse depends on how many and how much virtual worlds will share, as well as economic factors such as user spending and ownership restrictions. Liberating purchases from a single title can lead to higher prices and more purchases. Users will resist buying duplicate virtual items, and expected obsolescence constrains consumer spending.

Gaming platforms generally prohibit users from reselling or trading virtual items, with limited exceptions. Ownership of virtual items is not guaranteed and companies can repossess them at any time. Tencent's lawsuit regarding in-game assets in China sparked outrage among gamers. Establishing firm ownership rights is important for investment and growth in virtual worlds, as it incentivizes stakeholders and reduces risks.

Limiting investment and standardization in the Metaverse economy hurts developers, users, and the gaming platform. Toxic behavior in gaming harms everyone and will eventually drive standardization and interoperation. The example of Protocol Wars and other industries shows that economic gravity drives standardization over time. The gaming industry's own game engines demonstrate the benefits of standardization.

Reaching the entirety of the video game market is difficult due to the large number of platforms and devices available, each requiring unique code. Ignoring a large part of the market is also expensive. In the past, developers could reach a large portion of players with just one console, but today there are multiple consoles, PC platforms, and mobile computing platforms. In terms of online networking, a 1995 map reflected the belief in fragmented networks and protocol suites rather than a unifying standard.

The internet became the core gateway between private and public networks, enabling communication between them. Cross-platform game engines like Unity and Unreal emerged in response to fragmentation and solve it at a low cost, increasing revenue potential for developers. The proliferation of these engines should make it easier to bring together fragmented virtual worlds into a unified Metaverse.

Sony's policy did not support cross-play, cross-purchasing, or cross-progression between PlayStation and other platforms. Critics argued that this was due to Sony's dominant market position. Sony changed its stance and enabled cross-play, cross-purchasing, and cross-progression in response to the success of Fortnite, a game that emphasized cross-platform gaming.

Fortnite was a rare game that could be played on many platforms and was designed as a social, live-service game. It became the most popular AAA game globally and generated record-breaking revenue. Sony's competitors embraced cross-platform services for Fortnite, but Sony initially resisted it. However, Sony changed its thinking when it realized that it was missing out on most of the game's revenue and driving PlayStation players to competing platforms.

Sony changed its policies to allow cross-platform play, progression, and purchasing after pressure from upset users and Epic accidentally activating cross-play on PlayStation without permission. This allowed hit games to be accessed on all computing devices, and every console now competes on hardware, content, and services. Sony still thrives, with the PlayStation driving over 45% of total Fortnite revenues. Sony's decision to open up its closed platform also provides a potential economic solution to the challenge of interoperability. Epic had to true up its payments to the PlayStation store to avoid revenue leakage, and this model aids all market participants.

Discord emerged to meet the demand of gamers who wanted to hang out and play games ad hoc, and it operates across all major computing platforms. Discord has a larger and more active gamer communication network than any single immersive gaming platform, and its success drove Xbox and PlayStation to announce native integrations of Discord into their closed platforms. Standardizing game engines and communication suites is complex compared to standardizing 3D-object conventions, which has yet to emerge despite billions spent on non-standardized virtual objects and environments.

Interchange solutions are emerging to reuse digital assets without additional cost. Nvidias Omniverse is a good example of an interchange platform and 3D standard that enables companies to collaborate in shared virtual simulations using 3D assets and environments from different file formats, engines, and other rendering solutions. Collaboration leads to the emergence of formal and informal conventions, and as 3D collaboration grows, standards will naturally emerge. Universal Scene Description (USD), developed by Pixar, provides a common language for defining, packaging, assembling, and editing 3D in Omniverse. Helios is another example of a proprietary real-time rendering engine used by Industrial Light & Magic, which is compatible with select engines and file formats. Standards will emerge as collaboration grows, as exemplified by the global mandate for English as the official corporate language by many of the world's largest corporations in the early 2010s.

Globalization has led to de facto standards in currencies, units, and exchange. English has become the de facto language of international communication, with 67% of individuals preferring to conduct work in English according to a 2012 poll. Omniverse and Epic Games are pioneering data standards and repurposing of assets across multiple environments, with Rocket League and Fortnite offering limited-time modes and exclusive outfits and achievements. Epic Games' investments in building the Metaverse include the acquisition of Tonic Games Group, makers of Fall Guys and other games, and may extend its Rocket League experiments across Tonics titles and those from its Epic Games Publishing.

Epic Games is seeking to establish common standards and frameworks for shared virtual goods with their cross-title assets and achievements model, which aims to reduce friction to accessing different games and increase player engagement and spending. Other socially focused software giants such as Facebook are also looking to establish interoperable avatars to their authentication APIs to benefit from more registered users. The goal is to drive standardization around various offerings and services for third-party games.

Virtual platforms such as Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox have become necessary for marketing and brand building. Epic is driving the interoperation of competing intellectual properties, but this creates a philosophical problem. Brands must allow unlimited-term licenses and little editorial control to participate in these experiences, which often have overlapping marketing windows. Interoperability of avatars is important for users' consistent representation, and cross-title services such as Facebook serve as a standardization process.

Interoperability in the Metaverse is desirable for franchise owners and financial incentives and competitive pressure will likely drive its development. Interoperability could lead to new products and business models, similar to how free-to-play gaming models increased revenue and player engagement. However, not all virtual worlds will adopt interoperability.

Before examining the role of blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and non-fungible tokens in the Metaverse, it is important to consider the role of hardware and payments. Devices like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets are often assumed to be the best way to experience the Metaverse, but sales have not yet met consumer demand. Differences in conventions between game engines help to understand the challenges of interoperability. "AAA" refers to video games with large production and marketing budgets.

Google's Metaverse ambitions involve supporting its Google Glass Enterprise Edition and acquiring AR glasses start-ups like North and Raxium. Their efforts in VR included Google Cardboard, which sold over 15 million viewers and had nearly 200 million Cardboard-enabled apps downloaded, but it was shut down in 2019, along with the Expeditions program. Google launched its second VR platform, Daydream, in 2016, but it also failed to meet expectations.

Google's Daydream VR platform had a dedicated handheld remote control and NFC chip but failed to gain consumer interest and was cancelled along with Google Cardboard. Despite this, Google views AR and VR as central to its Metaverse strategy, and plans to release a new headset platform in 2024. Amazon's Fire Phone, which had front-facing cameras and Firefly software, was their biggest failure, resulting in a $170 million write-down, but they later began work on Echo Frames, glasses without any AR or VR features.

The article discusses the progress and investments made by major tech companies in AR and VR devices. The first generation of Amazon's Echo Frames did not sell well, while Facebook's Oculus Quest 2 sold over 10 million units, but has not replaced the PC. Apple has acquired several start-ups related to AR and VR, including Vrvana, Akonia, and NextVR, and is granted over 2,000 patents per year, many of which relate to VR.

The article discusses how companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, Snap, and Niantic are investing in AR/VR hardware despite previous lackluster sales, in the hope that they can displace Apple and Google. The US Army's $22 billion deal with Microsoft for HoloLens devices is seen as a sign that mixed-reality devices are the future. There are technical shortfalls in current VR and AR headsets that are holding up mass adoption.

Early mobile devices lacked key features such as small size, mobile data network access, and fingertip navigation. AR and VR devices have display resolution and refresh rate limitations that affect their effectiveness, with experts suggesting at least 120 Hz is needed for VR to avoid disorientation and nausea. AR devices have limited field of view, with Snaps AR glasses covering only around 10% of what can be seen and Microsoft's HoloLens 2 leaving 80% of a user's eyesight without augmentation. Both AR and VR devices can cause motion sickness in some users.

Current AR and VR devices have limitations in terms of weight, battery life, field of view, resolution, and processing power, with the Oculus Quest 2 being limited to 18 concurrent users in a game. Fitting a supercomputer into a comfortable headset frame is a challenge and may have real limitations. Tech companies need to find ways to improve displays, reduce weight, increase battery life, while adding new functionality to improve AR and VR devices.

AR and VR devices require additional cameras to perform various functions such as tracking user's hands and face. However, the additional cameras add weight, bulk, cost, and require more computing and battery power. Consumer AR devices need to be more powerful than HoloLens and smaller than Spectacles 4 to take off, but this is a technical challenge requiring significant investment.

The development of AR and VR devices will involve a constant process of improvement to reduce their size and cost while increasing their functionality. Success in the market will ultimately depend on the experiences offered by each platform. The history of the iPhone demonstrates the importance of combining components in innovative ways and making bold choices, such as betting on touchscreens, targeting consumers, and setting higher prices to offer superior value.

The article discusses the importance of balancing complexity and simplicity in product design, using the example of the iPhone's home button. Despite taking up valuable space, the button was deemed essential for introducing users to touchscreens and pocket-sized computing. Additionally, the home button enabled the introduction of multitasking, which was managed through its use. Although the first few iPhones could have supported multitasking, Apple chose to ease users into mobile computing by focusing on simplicity rather than incorporating all available features at once.

The article explores the balance between introducing new technology and easing users into it, using examples from the evolution of the iPhone. Apple chose to focus on simplicity and gradually introduce new features, such as multitasking and the removal of the physical home button, as users became comfortable with mobile computing. The article also highlights past controversies over features like pinch-to-zoom and the app store model. The article suggests that the VR and AR industry may face similar debates over pricing and target markets.

- Facebook is focusing on VR before AR and cloud game streaming could be the way for VR users to participate in high concurrency simulations - Facebook's AR devices are likely to emphasize face- and eye-tracing cameras, sensors, and capabilities over device profile or aesthetics - Oculus will remain open to enable developers to directly distribute their apps, but this produces new risks in user and data privacy - Hardware challenges are greater for AR and VR than for smartphones, and interface design will be harder - There are also other efforts to produce Metaverse-focused hardware that complements primary computing devices, such as smart gloves and bodysuits for gamers.

- Haptic wearables provide physical feedback to simulate virtual world experiences, but are currently costly and limited to industrial purposes - Haptic vibration technology has advanced and context-specific resistance can be programmed into controllers - Ultrasonic sound-based haptic devices can produce force fields in front of users that can sense a variety of objects and interactions - Gloves and bodysuits can capture a user's motion data and reproduce their body and gestures in a virtual environment in real-time.

Tracking cameras in the Metaverse require unobstructed views and struggle to track multiple users, while smart wearables like Apple Watch and CTRL-labs' armbands offer impressive gesture recognition capabilities using standard sensors and electromyographic signals. CTRL-labs' armbands can reproduce minute gestures inside virtual worlds, including individual finger movements and controlling robots.

Facebook plans to release a smartwatch with detachable cameras and its own wireless data plan. Google's Fitbit acquisition will lead to smaller and more integrated wearables that enhance interactions with the Metaverse. The future of computing may lie in smaller devices like Google's abandoned Contact Lens project that monitored glucose levels through soft lenses with a wireless chip and glucose sensor powered by a smartphone.

Smart lens technology is still being invested in by major technology companies despite the cancellation of Google's "lens" program. Brain-to-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been under development since the 1970s and attract significant investment. Elon Musk's Neuralink is working on an implantable device for the human brain, and Facebook recently announced the cancellation of its BCI program. While BCIs are partially invasive or noninvasive, smart lens technology seems more achievable.

Facebook has decided to focus on a different neural interface approach for AR/VR technology after canceling its head-mounted optical BCI program due to ethics concerns. Google's Project Starline uses depth sensors and cameras to create a more immersive video conferencing experience. The hardware around us, including wearable and implantable devices, will play a significant role in our transition to the Metaverse. Imagined commands and non-invasive BCIs have the potential to provide new ways of interacting with VR and AR technology.

Starline users had better focus, non-verbal communication, and memory recall compared to typical video calls. High-quality mirror worlds or digital twins of physical spaces are now easier and cheaper to produce with advanced hardware such as Leica's photogrammetric cameras and Planet Labs' satellites. Planet Labs' satellites cover nearly the entire earth daily across eight spectra bands, producing high-resolution imagery that includes details such as heat, biomass, and haze. The cost per performance of these satellites has improved by 1,000 times since 2011 according to Planet Labs CEO, Will Marshall.

Advanced technologies such as real-time tracking cameras, projection cameras, and sensors enable the production of higher-quality and less-expensive fantasy worlds. Examples include Amazon Go stores that use facial scanning and movement tracking to create digital twins of customers and Google's Starline that allows workers to be present in the store remotely. Sensors and wireless chips enable a construction site with drones overhead to provide real-time monitoring of activities. Not all of these experiences require the Metaverse or virtual simulation.

- 3D environments and data presentation are more intuitive - Google's second-largest acquisition was Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in 2014, followed by Dropcam for $555 million - Most devices for the Metaverse era will likely be the ones currently used - Experts estimate fewer than 250 million active VR and AR headsets in use by 2030 - AR and VR devices face technical, financial, and experiential obstacles - AR and VR devices will not be a person's first computing device, nor their first portable

- AR and VR may replace most devices, but unlikely to happen soon - Smartphones and tablets are rapidly improving for Metaverse-related advancements, including CPU and GPU power and infrared sensors - Infrared sensors enable users to reproduce their face in real-time for avatars or virtual augmentations - Lidar scanners in smartphones and tablets have transformed virtualization companies like Matterport

Smartphone technology, such as high-resolution cameras and ultra-wideband chips, can create high-fidelity virtual objects and maps, allowing for increased precision and reduced costs in synthetic goods and AR experiences. This technology is becoming increasingly integrated into daily life and has contributed to the rising average sales price of smartphones.

Consumers want more capabilities from their iPhones, rather than lower prices. Some envision smartphones as edge computers or servers that provide connectivity and computing to the world around us. The iPhone already offloads tasks to more powerful devices, such as Siri queries to Apple's servers and photo storage to the cloud. Virtual reality (VR) headsets must improve screen resolution, frame rates, and reduce costs for mainstream adoption. The Oculus headset can connect to a powerful PC via Oculus Link for improved performance.

Sony's PlayStation VR2 has better specs than the Oculus Quest 2, but requires a PlayStation 5 console and is more expensive. It's more practical to focus on the capabilities of a single device, rather than investing in multiple devices with limitations. Personal data should be sent to a trusted device, rather than being collected by multiple devices. The devices needed to support the Metaverse can be categorized into primary computing devices (smartphones), and secondary or supporting computing devices (PCs and VR/AR headsets).

Devices for the Metaverse can be categorized into primary, secondary, and tertiary, and will increase engagement time and revenues. Physical devices are the gateway to accessing and creating Metaverse experiences, giving device manufacturers and operators significant power. Hardware influences how the Metaverse works and the economic activity it generates, which leads to a fight for control and a cut of the profits. Understanding this requires a deep dive into payments.

The number of satellites of China and Russia are far fewer than those of Planet Labs but are larger and more capable. The success of the Metaverse depends on its economy, which is expected to follow the patterns of the real-world economy with attributes such as competition, profitable businesses, trust in rules and fairness, consumer rights, spending, and disruption. The US economy is an example of this with millions of different businesses, including small-to-medium ones, employing over half of the workforce and responsible for half of GDP.

Apple designs an increasing portion of its components but most still come from competitors. The American economy, backed by an elaborate legal system, enables companies like Apple to succeed through their integration with content, apps, and data made by other companies. The success of Apple is due to its dynamism, its ability to integrate its products with other companies, and the existence of a legal system that instills faith in market participants. Without these factors, the outcome of the American economy and Apple's success could have been different.

The birth of companies such as Google and Facebook is linked to the United States v. Microsoft Corporation court case, which found the latter to have unlawfully monopolized its operating system. The first sale doctrine allows someone who buys a copyrighted work to dispose of it as they wish. Payment rails are an important aspect of the Metaverse and are complex, automated, and difficult to build. Companies such as Visa, MasterCard, and Alipay are among the world's most valuable public companies, and financial conglomerates such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America hold trillions in deposits and manage the transfer of trillions.

There is a fight to become the dominant payment rail in the Metaverse, which is seen as the central battleground and greatest impediment. The author will discuss the major payment rails of the modern era, the role of payments in the gaming industry, and how mobile payment rails are being used to control technology and stifle competition. They will also touch on why many see blockchains and cryptocurrencies as the solution to the current virtual economy's problems. The most common payment rails in the US are Fedwire, CHIPS, ACH, credit cards, PayPal, and peer-to-peer payment services, each with different requirements and merits. The author will come back to this later when discussing blockchains and cryptocurrencies.

Fedwire is a system for transferring money electronically between banks, spanning the 12 Reserve Banks, Federal Reserve Board, and US Treasury. It started with Morse code and moved to computer operations. Both sender and receiver must have a bank account, wires can't be used for automatic recurring payments, and once sent, wires cannot be reversed. There are fees for sending and receiving wires, and they are impractical for small-dollar value transfers. CHIPS is a competitor to Fedwire established by major US banks to reduce transfer costs, and it holds outgoing wires until the end of the day before netting them against incoming wires.

CHIPS is a competitor to Fedwire and holds outgoing wires until the end of the day before netting them against incoming wires. International wires typically take two to three days due to time zones, money-laundering protections, and other governmental restrictions. Wires are considered the most secure way to send money but are the most complex and time-consuming. In 2021, $992 trillion in value was sent via US Fedwire, while CHIPS cleared over $700 trillion. ACH payments can only be made during business hours and require the sender and recipient to each have a bank account. ACH payments face geographic limitations and the fees associated with ACH payments are their primary limitation.



 ACH-based transfers are offered by most banks for free or a low fee of $5. 

 ACH payments are less than 1% per transaction, reversible, and allow payment requests. 

 ACH is typically used for payments to vendors, employees, and bills, with an estimated $70 trillion processed in 2021. 

 A major downside of ACH is its slow processing time of one to three days, with no confirmation of a successful transaction until an error occurs. 

 Credit card systems have existed since the late 19th century, with physical cards or online information being captured and submitted to the customers' credit card.



 Credit cards enable transactions to be placed quickly, with a fee of 1.5% to 3.5% of the transaction, generating a third of revenue through other services sold to merchants and credit card owners. 

 Credit cards work globally, are supported by almost all merchants, and payments can be reversed but are less secure and suffer from fraud. 

 An estimated $6 trillion was spent via credit card in the US in 2021. 

 Digital payment networks like PayPal and Venmo serve as a centralized bank for users, funded by ACH payments, credit card payments, or transfers.

Digital payment platforms like PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App offer instant, fee-based transactions primarily within their networks. They charge fees for payments to businesses and for transferring money to a bank account. These platforms are geographically limited and do not support peer-to-peer payments outside their networks. Despite varying in security, fees, and speed, payment rails compete with each other, offering advantages and drawbacks with various fee structures. The credit card networks offer alternative options, and users can make some transfers for free by lending their money to a given network for two to three days. In 2021, these platforms processed an estimated $2 trillion across over 30 billion transactions.

The payment rails of the virtual economy are more expensive, cumbersome, slow to change, and less competitive than those in the real world, despite the virtual economy's large size and rapid growth. Virtual payment rails are really a stack of different real-world rails and a forced bundle of many other services, which makes them inefficient. The 30% fee for licensing and manufacturing game cartridges that became an industry standard in the 1980s has persisted in today's virtual economy, resulting in costly transactions. In 2021, consumers spent more than $50 billion on digital-only video games and nearly $100 billion more on in-game goods, outfits, and extra lives.

The 30% fee charged by gaming platforms on in-game purchases like subscriptions and updates is rationalized as a means of enabling game developers to make money and recouping platform expenditures. The fee is not set by the market and is largely borne by consumers through internet fees and console hard drives. The platforms sell their consoles at a loss, but investments in research and development, marketing, and exclusive content contribute to profitability. While the fee may have a rationale, it is not necessarily fully earned, and consumers are forced to pay for it.

Consoles are sold below cost, and offering developers better terms would not benefit the consoles as game-makers release titles on multiple platforms. Proprietary tools, APIs, and services of consoles add cost to developers, produce limited value, and lock in customers and developers to the detriment of both groups. Console operating systems produce software development kits that include collections of APIs to communicate with device components, but consoles restrict developers from using free and open-source alternatives. The 30% cut does not necessarily benefit developers, and consoles may add cost to game-makers.

Each gaming platform uses its own proprietary API for better software performance and user satisfaction. Cross-platform game engines like Unity and Unreal are used to accommodate the variations in API collections. Multiplayer game management has shifted from Xbox Live to game makers due to the growing importance of online services and cross-play support. Most developers prefer managing their own live ops, and it's not feasible for Xbox to manage live services for games integrated into other platforms.

Game developers are obligated to pay the full 30% to gaming platforms and work through their online account systems, creating extra distance between developers and players. Players are locked into hardware-based platforms and must repurchase games if they switch platforms, making it more expensive to ever leave. Platforms also keep game-related content and trophies, which harms both developers and players. Platform services aim to justify the platforms' 30% fee and retain customers by making it harder to acquire customers from other platforms. The payment rails of console gaming.

The billing solutions offered by gaming platforms are bundled with various other entitlements, regardless of market rate or need. Steam, launched in 2003, became dominant despite lacking hardware. It simplified game storage and management, especially for online multiplayer games that required frequent updates.

Steam solved PC gaming problems by creating a centralized game launcher that simplified game storage and management, with additional services provided to developers for free. Steamworks forced games to use Steam's payment service for in-game transactions, with Valve receiving 30% of ongoing revenues. Steam is a critical innovation in PC gaming history, despite the higher cost of entry, and remains a significant player in the industry.

Valve's Steam platform remains dominant in PC gaming despite commoditization of distribution, rights management and online services. Competitors like EA Origin and Amazon have struggled to disrupt Steam's power and centrality in the market. Steam's success is attributed to its exceptional service, rich feature set and policies such as forcible bundling of distribution, payments, online services, and entitlements. Any game purchased through Steam will forever require Steam to be played, ensuring its ongoing dominance.

Steam's dominance in PC gaming is partly due to its policies, such as its cut of ongoing revenues and most favored nations (MFN) clauses that prevent publishers from offering lower prices on competing stores. Competitors like the Epic Games Store have attempted to disrupt Steam by reducing distribution fees, but Steam's MFN agreement applies even to a publisher's own store, making it difficult to undercut Steam's prices. Publishers who leave Steam would have to require users to repurchase titles through another channel and lose any achievements earned on the platform. Disrupting Steam would require splitting the fee reduction with developers and consumers, as well as overcoming the loyalty of Steam's users.

The Epic Games Store (EGS) offers benefits such as game ownership and player data ownership with lower fees of 12%, dropping to 7% for Unreal engine users. Epic used Fortnite to attract players to the store and gave away free copies of hit games. Steam cut its commission to 25% for titles exceeding $10 million in sales, but this benefited only large game developers. Valve did not open up.

Epic Games Store (EGS) shifted profits from Steam to developers but did not inspire further concessions from Steam. EGS showed limited evidence of sustainable success with players and had enormous losses. EGS revenue was mostly from Fortnite, with many players likely using EGS just to play Fortnite or for free games. Epic released 89 titles for free in 2021, but this did not lead to much user spending. The average user spent between $2 and $6 on non-Fortnite content.

Leaked documents suggest that Epic Games Store is losing a lot of money and will not break even until 2027. While PC gaming is an open platform, only one major store is profitable, and developers struggle to exist outside of it. The gaming industry has set a precedent for digital distribution, with Steve Jobs emulating the 30% commission model for the iTunes store and the iPhone app store. This economic precedent is relevant to the development of the Metaverse.

Apple's and Google's proprietary model has caused problems to surface globally, with the European Union suing Apple for allegedly using its fees to benefit its own software services and stifle competitors, and Epic Games suing both companies for their fees and controls being anti-competitive. While Google took a more permissive approach, it required users to navigate deep into their account settings and agree to additional steps and warnings, causing most users to download software directly from Google Play. Apple's store policies charged new economy businesses and waived fees on old economy ones.

Apple took no commission for transactions involving physical products and allowed direct use of third-party payment rails. Reader apps and interactive apps with transactions for digital content were required to offer in-app billing. While alternative online payment options were available, they were rarely used as users were not informed about them inside the app. Developers may need to offer significant discounts to entice users to use alternative payment methods outside of in-app purchases.

Apple's multi-category payment models in the App Store were based on where it believed it could exert leverage and create value. Mobile gaming was a significant growth driver for the App Store, generating the majority of the 10% of iOS app purchases billed by Apple. The App Store's revenue primarily came from a small but fast-growing segment of the world economy, and it took time for the App Store to become a large business worth scrutinizing. Apple initially doubted the success of the App Store, but mobile gaming has since become a significant contributor to its growth.

Apple's App Store, with its 30% fees, has become a profitable business that sells more iPhones and iPods. It has revenues of $73 billion with an estimated 70% margin and is one of the best businesses globally. If iOS were an open platform, profits would have been competed away, but this is not possible as Apple controls all the software on its devices. These issues have profound consequences for the Metaverse as the entire world is becoming game-like and forced into the 30% models of major platforms.

Apple's 30% commission stifles investment in the Metaverse, adversely affects business models, and cramps companies that are pioneering the Metaverse, such as integrated virtual world platforms. In the Metaverse, everything costs 30%, unlike the real world, where payment processing costs range from 0% to 5%, as there is no direct competition due to bundled capabilities. Netflix's decision to remove in-app billing from its iOS app cost them some sign-ups, but they saved 30% sent to Apple. However, adding mobile games to its subscription plan forced the company to return to Apple's payment service or stop offering an iOS app altogether.

In the digital economy, access to credit, payment networks, perks, and insurance are bundled together, with no competition between Android and iOS. Apple and Google collect 30% of the profits of a new digital business or digital sale, which is more than the average small-to-medium business profit margins in the US. Cutting the commissions of these platforms from 30% to 15% would more than double the profits of independent developers. This current dominance also leads to undesirable economic incentives, where companies may prioritize virtual products over physical ones.

Apple's policies in the digital economy and Metaverse determine how it is monetized and who leads the process. Apple collects 30% of profits from stand-alone virtual products, but no fees for physical products or virtual copies of them. The consequences of Apple's policies will shape the Metaverse's future, with some companies like Nike able to leverage their physical business to avoid fees, while most start-ups cannot rely on a pre-Metaverse business line. These issues will grow in the future, with implications for app developers and businesses in the Metaverse.

The article discusses the impact of in-app payment fees on developers, specifically in the context of educational and virtual world platforms. The author argues that the fees charged by platforms like Apple and Android, which can reach up to 30%, make it difficult for developers to recoup their investments and result in negative outcomes for students and creators. The article suggests that reducing these fees could lead to more investment in education and better products for users in virtual world platforms like Roblox.

The article discusses the impact of in-app payment fees on Roblox's revenue and the limited revenue sharing for developers. The author explains that a significant portion of the revenue goes to Apple, Roblox's core infrastructure, and overhead costs, leaving only a small amount for reinvestment in the platform. The article suggests that increasing developer revenue shares would require deepening Roblox's losses or halting its R&D, which is not a viable solution. However, the author predicts that Roblox's margins may improve over time due to scale-related margin gains.

The high costs associated with Roblox's infrastructure and safety expenses and store fees limit the company's profitability and may deter developers from using the platform. Apple's 30% cut and control over the App Store system hinders the growth of integrated virtual world platforms, nudging the Metaverse towards a fragmented system of interconnected virtual worlds, with Apple as the primary distributor of virtual software. These policies limit the growth potential of disruptive technologies in the virtual world industry.

The World Wide Web is considered by many to be a proto-Metaverse due to its interoperability and scalability, and several open standards are being developed to enhance its potential as a Metaverse platform. However, Apple's argument that its platform isn't closed because it provides access to the open web is not convincing, as native apps have better performance and are more efficient.

The web cannot provide rich real-time rendered 2D and 3D environments as effectively as native applications, which leads to sub-optimization and less reliable performance. Apple uses its control over its App Store to direct users and developers towards native apps, collecting a commission in the process. Safari underpins all iOS browsers, and Apple's technical decisions for its browser define what the web can and cannot offer. WebGL, a JavaScript API for complex browser-based rendering, has not been widely adopted by Safari.

Apple's iOS policies limit the headroom for web-based gaming, pushing more users and developers to its App Store. Apple's slow adoption of WebGL and its restrictive approach to cloud gaming also support this hypothesis. Cloud gaming threatens Apple's relationship with mobile app developers and reduces the need to buy new, higher-priced devices.

Apple has lifted its ban on cloud gaming apps, allowing developers to distribute their games through various applications on Apple devices. While cloud gaming was technically possible on iOS devices through the Safari browser, Apple's limitations on background data synchronization, Bluetooth connections, and push notifications made browser-based gaming unsatisfying. Apple's original argument for the ban, which was to protect users from inappropriate content and privacy violations, was inconsistent with its policies on other app categories such as Netflix and YouTube.

Apple's policies on cloud gaming apps were motivated by a desire to protect its own hardware and game sale businesses. The company revised its policies in 2020 to allow services like Google Stadia and Microsoft's xCloud to exist on iOS, but the new policies are widely criticized as anti-consumer. Cloud gaming services would need to submit every game and update to the App Store for review, giving Apple control over content release schedules and the ability to deny titles. Additionally, Stadia subscribers would need to download a dedicated app for each individual game. Apple's policies have been seen as inconsistent with its laissez-faire approach to other app categories, with critics arguing that Apple's main goal is to maintain control and profitability.

Leaked emails between Microsoft and Apple reveal that Apple's policies for game streaming services would require individual apps for each game, which would need to be updated and cause confusion for users. Game streaming services would also need to be sold through the App Store, and all subscription-based games must be made available for individual purchase. Microsoft and Facebook criticized Apple's policy as it creates a bad customer experience.

Microsoft and Facebook have criticized Apple's policy on game streaming services, stating that it prevents discovery of new games and access to high-quality games instantly on iOS apps. Apple's stringent control on emergent payment rails, such as NFC mobile payments, with the sole exception being Apple Pay, is also a concern. Apple claims that its policies are intended to protect its customers and their data, but critics argue that there is no evidence to suggest that other companies would endanger users.

The article discusses Apple Pay and its potential implications as smartphones become more powerful and serve as passports to the virtual and physical worlds. It also mentions Apple's approach to blockchains and cryptocurrencies, which is problematic for blockchain enthusiasts due to App Store policies and platform incentives. The use of NFC for purposes other than purchasing is also discussed, and it is suggested that Apple may need to place additional security requirements on NFC purchases.

The article discusses how major platforms like Apple and Sony prohibit blockchain apps and games on their devices, citing reasons such as battery drain and strain on device resources. However, this prohibition prevents devices from participating in the blockchain economy and offering their idle computing power for decentralized computing. The platforms also do not allow games that accept cryptocurrencies or NFTs, possibly due to conflicts with their revenue models. The article suggests that allowing such transactions would be difficult to justify taking a 30% commission from the purchase or selling a multi-thousand- or million-dollar NFT.

Apple's policies on cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have caused confusion, as users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies through trading apps, but not NFTs. Apple's policies benefit neither developers nor customers, as NFT marketplaces can only serve as a catalogue, and blockchain-based games are limited to simple graphics and turn-based play. The conflict arises as the Metaverse supposes the next platform is not based on hardware, and digital payment rails require physical counterparts.

The transition to the Metaverse requires hardware, and every hardware player is competing to be the payment gateway, which harms the rights of users and developers. The two smartphone platforms extensively bundle their respective stacks, making it difficult for regulatory efforts to introduce more competition. Even when a bill passed in South Korea banning app store operators from requiring their own payment systems, Google announced that apps using alternative payment services would have to pay a new fee, almost the same as the old fee. This makes it challenging for developers to use alternative payment rails.

Dutch regulators ordered Apple to allow dating apps to use third-party payment services in the Netherlands. Apple updated its policies, but the new version cannot use its payment solution, has a transaction fee of 27%, and must display a disclaimer. Facebook is investing in AR, VR, brain-to-machine interfaces, and smartwatches, as it lacks a leading device and relies on competitors' platforms, hindering its cloud gaming service and revenue collection.

Horizon Worlds cannot offer developers a greater revenue cut than iOS or Android. Apples App Tracking Transparency changes require opt-in permission from users, reducing the efficacy of advertising and increasing in-app payments, where Apple collects a 15%-30% fee. Mark Zuckerberg estimated that the policy change would reduce revenue by $10 billion. Apple's ad business had 17% of all iOS app installations before ATT and 60% market share six months later. Facebook needs devices to run independently of iOS or Android devices to solve this problem, but they may be more expensive and limited.

The author suggests that the trend of disruption in the digital era through new computing devices may be a false hope, as the dominance of mobile phones could continue with the rise of AR and VR headsets, smart lenses, and brain-to-machine interfaces. The role of payment rails in the development of the Metaverse is discussed, with a case study of WeChat in China transforming the economy by offering direct connection to bank accounts, low transaction fees, and using common standards (QR codes) built into a messaging app. This led to the success of the domestic video gaming industry and the adoption of digital payments and services.

Tencent's WeChat app in China was able to transform the economy by offering direct connection to bank accounts, low transaction fees, and using common standards. The app became so powerful that even Apple allowed it to operate its own in-app app store and directly process in-app payments. Developers and creators in the West may need to find ways around gatekeepers for the Metaverse to emerge, which is why there is enthusiasm for blockchains. Apple's commission fees for subscription apps only apply to a small portion of customers, and the company typically forces third-party browsers to use older and slower versions of WebKit than iOS Safari.

Blockchains are databases managed by a decentralized network of validators, in contrast to centralized databases managed by a single party. Blockchain records sit in no single location and are maintained through consensus across a network of autonomous computers. The decentralized nature of blockchains provides relative incorruptibility and is a source of confusion for some. There is ongoing debate about the relevance of blockchain technology to the Metaverse. Developers cannot afford to wait years for a standard to be supported and cannot bet their futures on a particular technology.

Decentralized databases, like blockchains, are managed by a network of validators rather than a single party, but are more expensive and energy-consuming than centralized databases. Due to these issues, most blockchain-based experiences store data in traditional databases rather than on-chain. Critics argue that anything not fully decentralized is effectively fully centralized. The upside of fully decentralized databases is modest, and there is a fear of relying on a collection of unknown validators to protect wealth. The benefits of decentralized databases lie in their potential for new forms of collaboration and governance beyond the limitations of traditional centralized systems.

Blockchains are programmable payment rails that are considered the first digitally native payment rails. The Bitcoin blockchain operates its own cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and compensates processors with Bitcoin for handling transactions, making it trustless and transparent. Blockchains are also permissionless, allowing anyone to become a network validator and use cryptocurrency. These attributes improve security, decrease cost, and increase capacity in a self-sustaining system.

As more validators join a blockchain network, prices decrease through competition, which increases decentralization and makes it harder to manipulate the ledger. Blockchains are trustless and permissionless, and revenue and profits are set by the market, creating competition and pushing fees down. Ethereum is a decentralized network that compensates its operators with Ether and allows developers to build their own decentralized applications and issue their own tokens. Competition enhances network performance, attracts more usage, and produces more transactions. Anyone can program their own applications on top of Ethereum.

Ethereum is a decentralized network with no single decision-maker or managing institution. Its community governs changes, encouraging developers to compete with its core functionality. Ethereum's detractors criticize its high processing fees, long processing times, and difficult programming language. Entrepreneurs have built competing blockchains or Layer 2 solutions to address these issues, which operate as mini-blockchains with their own programming logic and network. Some Layer 2 scaling solutions batch transactions, while others simplify transaction validation by polling just a portion of the network.

Validators on some blockchain networks can propose transactions without solving the underlying cryptographic equation, with bounties offered to other validators to prove dishonesty. Sidechains allow tokens to be moved on and off of Ethereum, serving like a petty cash drawer. Some argue that Layer 2s are a patchwork solution, but their trustless and permissionless programming enables competing Layer 1s to bridge into it. Android's open-source mobile operating system was collectively steered by the Open Handset Alliance.



The Open Handset Alliance (OHA) prioritized open source technologies and had 34 members at launch. 

Members had to agree not to fork Android or support those who did. 

In 2012, Google began building its own Nexus line of Android devices and purchased Motorola. 

Google moved key services outside the operating system into Google Play Services, requiring compliance with Google's own certifications. 

Analysts considered Android's progressive closure a response to Samsung's growing success with the operating system. 

Samsung had become increasingly aggressive with its alterations to the stock version of Android, producing and marketing its own interface (TouchWiz) and preloading its devices with its own suite of apps that competed with those offered by Google.



Samsung's TouchWiz OS threatened to disintermediate Google from its developers and users. 

The future of the Metaverse offers the opportunity to disrupt today's gatekeepers, but many fear new ones may emerge. 

Dapps are only partially decentralized, with founding teams holding a large portion of the tokens, but their success depends on attracting developers, users, and capital providers. 

Many dapps commit to progressive decentralization to maintain community support.

As successful apps accumulate more users and data, they tend to become more controlling by using their growing might to lock in developers and users, making it difficult to export accounts or use competing apps. This is why many apps close their APIs as they scale. However, most blockchains are designed to prevent this arc of centralization.

Blockchain-based apps can maintain the value of tokens for developers while giving users custody of their data, identity, wallet, and assets via records on the blockchain, disrupting the traditional developer arc. This does not commodify applications, but instead recognizes ownership of a user's data as the primary store of value. Although blockchain technology still falls short of modern performance expectations, its success in total transaction value and processing power suggests potential for disruption.

The use of blockchain technology for payments and ownership of virtual goods allows for independent and anonymous transactions across multiple wallets, without the need for a bank account or long-term agreements. Transactions are completed quickly and can be confirmed by both parties. While most transactions involve cryptocurrency investments and trading, blockchain technology is also used for non-fungible token (NFT) collections, providing a truer sense of ownership compared to centralized server models.

Blockchain technology enables unrestricted right to resale and ownership of virtual goods, creating a sense of possession and value that is unique to each token. NFTs have gained popularity, with billions of dollars spent on collectibles like NBA Top Shots, Cryptopunks, Axies, and Bored Apes. While the amount spent on NFTs is significant, it is not clear how it compares to traditional video game content managed by a traditional database.

The net spending on NFTs is less than traditional virtual assets as NFTs can be resold while traditional virtual assets cannot. The floor market cap of the 100 largest NFT collections was around $20 billion by the end of 2021, which is a quarter of the traditional gaming market. Critics argue that the value of NFTs is speculative, but their resellability is seen as a key factor that makes them valuable. NFTs can also be lent and generate revenue for the owner. The comparison between the NFT and global art markets is instructive as to the scale of the NFT market.

NFT spending has grown rapidly in recent years, but is still far smaller than spending on traditional virtual items. The utility of NFTs is currently limited by the lack of support for them in major video games and platforms. Most successful NFT experiences are based around collecting rather than active play, and only a few million people have purchased NFTs. Interoperability is a key factor in unlocking the potential of NFTs, but most NFTs today do not store the virtual goods data on the blockchain, limiting their portability.

Decentralized assets have centralized dependencies, making NFTs useless and propped up by fraud, speculation, and misunderstanding. However, blockchain has the potential to establish a common and independent registry for virtual goods and provide a technical solution for revenue leakage in the Metaverse. The ability for players to buy virtual goods elsewhere and use them in different games endangers game developers' business models, but blockchain can enable virtual goods interoperability while protecting developers' revenues.

Interoperability in virtual goods can create value for others beyond the original creator, leading to revenue leakage. Taxes and duties or programmed commissions and degradation can facilitate interoperability, but perfection is impossible. Blockchain can produce a more interoperable virtual world through trustless, permissionless, and automatic compensation models. Blockchain-based virtual worlds can issue their own tokens as incentives for users, which can be awarded for contributing time or other resources.

Blockchain technology enables the creation of decentralized applications that use tokens to incentivize user participation and ownership. These tokens can have governance rights and appreciate in value. This model can reduce the need for investor funding and increase user engagement. Blockchain's trustless and permissionless structure can make such experiences more likely to succeed and sustainable. Uniswap and Sushiswap demonstrate the competition between dapp-to-user blockchain dynamics.

Dapps have few barriers to prevent the emergence of better versions of their functionality, which creates a user-beneficial arms race. Blockchain technology can be used to support the provision of compute-related gaming infrastructure, as seen with Otoy's RNDR network and Helium's decentralized wireless network for IoT devices. These startups use cryptocurrency tokens for transactions and incentivization.

Helium operates a network of over 625,000 hotspots in 165 countries that compensates users with its HNT token. The total value of Helium's tokens exceeds $5 billion. Helium faced adoption challenges until it began offering contributors direct compensation via cryptocurrency. While the long-term viability of Helium remains uncertain due to ISP violations, the company serves as a reminder of the potential in decentralized payment models. Blockchain-based games and gaming platforms received over $4 billion in venture investment, with a surge in development and talent. Total VC funding for blockchain companies and projects was roughly $30 billion, and speculation suggests another $100 billion-$200 billion has already been raised or earmarked by venture funds.

Experimentation with blockchain technology can lead to a future where exchangeable cryptocurrencies power the economies of various games and virtual goods are intended for interoperation. This transition will be eased by opening up economies and account systems to a system owned by the gaming community. The programmable payment rails of blockchain enable independent collaboration and easier funding of new projects, similar to the fixed rules of a vending machine. This system promotes trust without the need for a manager or lawyer.

Blockchains function like virtual vending machines that are much smarter, as they can track and value multiple contributors differently. Smart contracts can be easily written in minutes and serve various purposes, from fundraising to sharing tips. Smart contracts eliminate the need for credit card details and invoices, requiring only a cryptowallet with cryptocurrency.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are a Metaverse-era version of traditional corporations and nonprofits that use smart contracts to manage administrative tasks such as ownership rights, distribution of payments, and votes on bylaws. DAOs allow pseudonymous crypto users to collectively purchase expensive NFTs and manage disbursements. ConstitutionDAO, a notable example, raised more than $47 million to purchase a first edition of the US Constitution but ultimately lost to a private bidder. While DAOs have the potential to change the way people buy things and run organizations, they also reveal problems with the Ethereum blockchain, such as high processing costs.

The Ethereum blockchain's transaction fees caused issues for a DAO fundraising campaign, and some contributions were not reclaimed due to their low value. Despite this, high finance is starting to use DAOs, such as the Komorebi Collective. In 2021, a DAO was used to purchase a plot of land near Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, which had passed legislation recognizing the legitimacy of DAOs earlier in the year. CityDAO is an example of a DAO with no official leader, where decisions are made through voting and members can sell their membership tokens at any time. Wyoming is becoming a fundamental link between digital assets, crypto, and the physical world through its embrace of the DAO structure.

Friends with Benefits (FWB) is a DAO-based membership club where members buy tokens to gain access to private channels, events, and information, and each member is a part owner of FWB. The appreciation of tokens makes it difficult for spammers to join, and members are incentivized to invest their time and resources into the club. Social DAOs issue tokens to individual members for their contributions, and Nouns DAO is a remix of FWB with Cryptopunks, where new NFTs are auctioned, and the net proceeds go into the Nouns DAO treasury to fund proposals authored and voted on by NFT owners.

- Social DAOs and tokens can address toxicity on online networks - Kickstarter, Reddit, and Discord plan to shift to blockchain-based token models - Blockchain remains expensive and slow, hindering decentralization - Experts debate if decentralizing 3D virtual worlds is possible - Key technical problems may be resolved in time - Ethereum is overhauling its validation process and uses less energy than Bitcoin - Layer 2s and sidechains are proliferating.

- Newer Layer 1s, such as Solana, are matching Ethereum's programming flexibility with better performance - DAOs and smart contracts are not legally recognized in most countries and US states - Users can lie to the blockchain, and blockchains do not make everything trustless - Blockchain maximalists believe its economic forces will force corporations to change - Five ways to think about blockchain's significance: wasteful technology, inferior to alternatives but may lead to cultural change, enabling decentralized ownership, a tool for political activism, and a revolutionary tool for the Metaverse.

Blockchains may bring about more efficient and democratic compensation for open-source software. They are likely to become fundamental to various experiences, applications, and business models, and could potentially revolutionize virtual culture, commerce, and rights. Blockchains could also disrupt today's platform paradigms, which favor closed platforms, by offering a more fair and prosperous future for developers and users.

Blockchains provide a mechanism to aggregate significant and diverse resources at a scale that can contend with even the mightiest private companies, potentially disrupting their control over developers and users. Blockchains also offer an economic model to compensate contributors and promise developers greater profits than closed gaming platforms. Additionally, leaders of blockchain platforms and companies have less control over their users and developers, making it difficult to forcibly bundle user identity, data, payments, content, and services. However, not all data will be on-chain, so few experiences will be fully decentralized.

Blockchain-based platforms can be centralized due to control over proprietary code, IP, and data ownership. Lock-in habits can also prevent users from switching to better alternatives. Independent developers establish power rather than the underlying platform. Blockchains are seen as a requirement for a Metaverse that meets our expectations. Blockchain is considered a superset of everything in computing and is seen as a distributed computer that can run a billion times.

Leveraging the world's computing, storage, and networking infrastructure is necessary for real-time rendered and persistent world simulations. Blockchain technology is seen as a plausible path towards an ultimate long-term open framework for an open Metaverse. Tim Sweeney, the founder of Epic Games, remains optimistic about blockchain's potential, but acknowledges its misuse and the need for regulation. Sweeney highlights a problem often overlooked by blockchain enthusiasts, which is the potential for financial loss without intermediaries, regulatory oversight, or identity verification in the crypto space. Steam banned games that used blockchain technology, but Epic Games Store welcomes games that follow relevant laws, disclose their terms, and are age-rated.

The blockchain and NFT industry are facing issues such as copyright violations, money laundering, and user confusion. The potential of the blockchain remains uncertain, but its transparency and immutability are seen as the best way to prioritize the interests of developers and users. The major public blockchains are decentralized and community-run. Facebook allows Tinder users to sign up and log in using their Facebook account and populate their Tinder profile with photos from their Facebook profile, which benefits Facebook. The data is only exposed to the service on an as-needed basis.

Blockchains are fat protocols supporting thin applications, unlike the thin protocol and fat application model of the internet. The Metaverse's arrival time is uncertain, with industry leaders disagreeing on its timing, ranging from already being here to a few decades from now. The Metaverse's full vision requires certain elements, as outlined in Part II. The industry is still in the experimental stage, with a leap from a few years ago, but it's still primitive.

The start of the mobile internet era is difficult to pinpoint, with potential dates ranging from the first mobile phones to the introduction of the iPhone. Technological transformation is an iterative process with many different changes converging, and electrification serves as a case study for this. Electrification consisted of two separate waves of technological, industrial, and process-related transformation that began in the late 19th century and ran midway into the 20th century.

Electrification consisted of two waves of transformation, with the second wave seeing a shift towards designing factories end-to-end for electricity, replacing legacy infrastructure with bespoke electrically powered motors. The second wave led to benefits such as more space, light, and less dangerous equipment. The difference between the waves was not the portion of American industry using electricity, but the extent to which that portion was designed around it.

The second wave of industrial electricity adoption was characterized by a critical mass of interconnected innovations in power management, manufacturing hardware, production theory, and more, which enabled the Roaring Twenties and propelled the Second Industrial Revolution. This adoption was not driven by a single visionary or increasing number of industrial power stations, but by the availability of specialized equipment and the reconfiguration of production areas around the logic of the production process. Henry Ford's first moving assembly line, which used electricity and conveyor belts, significantly reduced production time and power usage, and spurred more investment and innovation in electricity-based infrastructure, equipment, and processes.

The rise of mobile was not just due to the iPhone, but a combination of innovations and contributions from various companies and organizations. The second iPhone, released in 2008, included 3G and the App Store, which made the mobile web usable and wireless networks and smartphones useful. The iPhone's success also depended on standards established by groups like the United Nations International Telecommunication Union and wireless providers like AT&T, as well as technologies from companies such as Infineon, Samsung, Corning, and Broadcom. These collective innovations and contributions enabled the mobile era.

The development of the iPhone 12 shows that ecosystem-wide innovation and investments were necessary for its creation. Apple alone could not have created the phone back in 2008 due to the lack of 5G networks, wireless standards, and game-engine technologies. The success of hardware improvements depended on the growth and profits of companies like Spotify, Netflix, and Instagram. Consumer habits and evolving technology enabled improvements in hardware and software, such as the removal of the physical home button on the iPhone.

The new iPhone design created more space for sensors and computing components, enabling more sophisticated software-based interaction models. While some executives believe the Metaverse has already arrived, it remains premature as few people engage with virtual worlds and they have little influence over society. However, a critical mass of working pieces, including affordable mobile computers with high-resolution touch displays and powerful CPUs and GPUs, are rapidly coming together, making the Metaverse a more realistic possibility.

The development of 4G mobile chipsets, wireless networks, programmable blockchains, and cross-platform gaming has enabled the creation of the Metaverse. Cross-platform gaming is particularly important because it allows users to play across different devices and operating systems, which is essential for the Metaverse to function as a virtual persistent simulation. This feature has increased engagement and the value of virtual worlds by joining together forked networks.

The rise of virtual worlds has had a disproportionate impact on independent developers who can benefit greatly from player spending. The success of games like Fortnite has shown that virtual items such as avatars and emotes can be highly profitable, even outgrossing traditional fashion brands. The growing acceptance of virtual worlds and the destigmatization of time spent in them has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with virtual weddings and funerals becoming more common. The rise of NFTs has further normalized the idea of virtual objects having significant value.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to increased usage and destigmatization of virtual worlds and activities, which attracted more users, investment, and brand participation. Major brands across various industries have now made the Metaverse a key part of their business strategy. Regulatory action against tech giants and the development of new technologies such as AR/VR headsets, blockchain, and low-latency cloud computing are potential drivers for further Metaverse growth.

Three major drivers of the Metaverse are: 1) Improvement and standardization of underlying technologies, including internet service, computing power, and virtual world platforms, as well as opening up of payments. 2) Ongoing generational change, with younger generations being more interactive and gaming-focused. 3) The eventual ushering in of the Metaverse through experiences that bring together these technological and generational changes.

The development of dynamic virtual worlds required creativity from developers. As younger generations grow up, they may shift from consumers of virtual worlds to becoming developers and business leaders. Online grocery shopping faced similar hesitancy but was adopted during the pandemic, leading to the realization that it is a convenient process. The Metaverse's impact in the future is unpredictable due to unforeseen technologies and feedback loops. However, it will transform many areas, drawing in users and money.

The education sector is likely to undergo significant transformation due to its critical importance, scarce resources, and unequal distribution. Baumol's Cost Disease reflects the rise in salaries in low-productivity jobs like teaching, which cannot keep up with salaries in high-productivity jobs. Despite advances in technology, teaching has seen a smaller increase in productivity compared to other sectors, and teaching salaries must compete with higher-paying jobs.

The cost of education has increased due to the resource-intensive nature of education, including physical resources and new technologies. Despite the expectation that remote learning would improve productivity, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that it is not effective, as students lose the benefits of being physically present in the classroom. Pedagogical research shows that field trips and in-person learning are more beneficial than virtual alternatives.

The loss of presence in remote learning results in the loss of important learning experiences such as hands-on learning and co-learning with classmates. New technologies such as volumetric display, VR and AR headsets, haptics, and eye-tracking cameras are being developed to improve remote learning and enhance the learning process. These technologies allow for virtual simulations that can supplement traditional demonstrations and make everything from building Rome to creating Rube Goldberg machines virtually possible.

Virtual reality (VR) and virtual worlds have the potential to enhance learning and expand access while reducing costs. VR lessons will be available on demand, accessible to students with disabilities, and can be priced at a fraction of the cost of in-person learning. Students will be able to perform dissections and travel through creatures' organ systems. VR experiences can also be supplemented by a dedicated live teacher. While there may be challenges, VR has the potential to bridge the gap between in-person and distance education, create competitive marketplaces for pre-made lessons and live tutors, and increase the reach of great teachers.

The Metaverse is not necessary for real-time rendered 3D educational worlds, but interoperation between experiences is valuable. The Metaverse will transform socially-focused experiences like exercise and fitness, with virtual games and avatars, and will also impact mindfulness, meditation, physiotherapy, psychotherapy, and dating through new technologies.

Dating apps have shifted from multiple-choice quizzes to photo-based models where users swipe left or right to show interest. New features such as games, quizzes, and shared playlists have been added, and immersive virtual worlds may be added in the future. Linear media like TV shows and films may also move to VR and AR technology for a more immersive experience.

The future of entertainment will involve interconnections between film and interactive experiences, facilitated by real-time rendering engines. Film and TV will not go away, but may be consumed via aggregator solutions or social media newsfeeds. The use of virtual and augmented reality may enable immersive experiences that blur the line between real and digital environments. Similar to how the internet disrupted the newspaper industry, the entertainment industry may undergo a similar transformation.

Hollywood has been integrating real-time rendering engines, such as Unity and Unreal, into the filming process in recent years. The director of The Lion King immersed himself in each scene through a Unity-based re-creation, using a VR headset to aid in shot placement, camera tracking, and lighting. Virtual production stages with high-density LED walls and ceilings were pioneered, allowing everyone inside to experience the virtual environment without wearing a headset and enabling real people to be seen in the environment. The use of LED lighting also allowed for more accurate lighting and shadows on the cast.

Industrial Light & Magic, a leader in virtual production, estimates that filming on LED volumes can be 30% to 50% faster and have lower post-production costs than using real-world sets and green screens. The hit show The Mandalorian was shot mostly on a virtual stage in California and cost much less per minute than typical Star Wars films. Virtual backlots allow for the creation and storage of virtual versions of every 3D object, texture, and environment, making it easier to film sequels and create derivative works. This could have implications for the future of the Metaverse, with companies potentially licensing and repurposing virtual assets for their own use.

Disney will create mini-worlds on Fortnite Creative for fans to join their heroes in canonical or noncanonical events and side missions. The sports industry may use instantaneously captured and reproduced video games to merge watching games, playing sports video games, participating in fantasy sports, making online wagers, and buying NFTs. The betting and gambling industry will be transformed by the metaverse.

Virtual entertainment is being reimagined through live motion-capture dealers, blockchain-based programming for virtual horse races, and interactive entertainment where audiences can affect simulations in real-time. Genvid Technologies hosted a Massively Interactive Live Event on Facebook Watch, called Rival Peak, where the audience could affect the simulation by solving puzzles or voting on the choices of AI characters. Rival Peak is an indication of what the future of live interactive entertainment could look like. Genvid launched The Walking Dead: The Last M.I.L.E. which allows viewers to decide who lives and who dies in The Walking Dead, while also steering competing factions of humans toward or away from conflict.

The text discusses the potential for high-fidelity real-time rendered versions of the Hunger Games played by celebrities and the blurring of lines between pornography and prostitution, especially in the sex work industry. With advancements in technology, sex work could involve internet-connected haptic devices, immersive AR and VR headsets, and high-concurrency GPUs. However, there are concerns about abuse and platform power as major computing platforms do not allow sex or pornography-based applications.

The text discusses how the policies of major technology companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google effectively block the advancement of the sex work industry in terms of technology, despite the potential for higher incomes and greater safety for sex workers. Additionally, virtual worlds have largely been ignored by advertisers and fashion houses, but in 2021, brands like Adidas, Moncler, Balenciaga, Gucci, and Prada have started paying attention to them. However, advertising in virtual spaces is challenging due to the difficulty in updating in-game ads, which is why books typically lack ads.

In-game advertising in video games is a challenge due to the gaming community's resistance to it. While traditional advertising mediums have always had ads, in-game ads are still being explored, and determining their core ad unit and pricing is a challenge. Most digital advertising today is done programmatically. While some games have in-game billboards, their implementation varies.

The varying speeds and situations in virtual worlds make it difficult to value and purchase in-game billboards. Inserting personalized ads and determining when they should be shared with friends is also challenging. Augmented reality advertising is easier conceptually, but execution is harder as obtrusive ads could cause accidents. Ad buyers will have to find a way to be relevant in the Metaverse, and the ad tech industry will have to figure out how to offer and measure programmatic ads. Nike's immersive Fortnite Creative Mode world shows the need for a fundamental rethinking of how to advertise a given product in the Metaverse.

The potential for successful advertising in the Metaverse is high, but it requires building virtual products and experiences that users actively engage with, which most ad agencies and marketing departments lack the skills for. Upstart brands used novel marketing techniques to win market share, but these strategies are no longer unique. Virtual worlds remain largely unexplored and offer an opportunity for brands to differentiate themselves. Dropping a new, drivable car model into a virtual world is a challenging but effective way for carmakers to make a presence in the Metaverse.

Fashion brands will need to enter the Metaverse to meet the need for new ways of expressing identities and showing off, or risk being replaced by new labels. The Metaverse may also place pressure on physical sales, but physical sales may be used to facilitate and bolster the value of digital sales. The Metaverse will start with consumer leisure before moving into industry, and the expansion into industry will be slow due to high technical requirements and the need for reeducation. Fortnite generates more revenue than any other game in history, primarily through the sale of cosmetic items, which reiterates the importance of identity and community-oriented items in the Metaverse. Successful NFT collections also prioritize identity-oriented profile pictures.

Investments in the Metaverse will initially be constrained, and profits disappointing, with many existing out of sight from the average consumer. A 3D-printed and modular scale model of a redevelopment project in Tampa enabled stakeholders to plan and understand the project in unique ways, including how it would affect the surrounding area and emergency response times. The benefits of such simulations are difficult to describe in writing.

Digital twin simulations will be used to operate buildings and businesses, enabling real-time tracking and alteration of signage and directing customers. 3D simulations are already used in architecture, engineering, and construction, as well as defense, with potential applications in medicine and healthcare. A recent example is the use of AR-surgery at Johns Hopkins.

For consumer VR/AR headsets to gain adoption, they must be more compelling than alternative experiences such as console games or messaging apps. While immersion is a differentiator, there are still many drawbacks. VR games are not yet good enough to compete with console or smartphone titles for many gamers. However, the use of AR/VR in surgery could have a meaningful impact on outcomes, justifying their cost and use. Neal Stephenson described interactive books as a precursor to such technology in 1995. As the metaverse will transform most industries and reach nearly every person on earth, there are broad questions to be addressed about its winners and losers.

Most corporate executives believe that the Metaverse will be worth multiple trillions of dollars, with some predicting it will exceed the value of the physical world. However, projecting the size of the Metaverse economy is a challenging exercise, as it is deeply intertwined with and dependent upon the traditional economy. Trying to value the economy of the mobile internet, internet, or digital computing era has been difficult, and most analysts and journalists sum the revenues of the companies that support these categories. There is a lack of consensus on what should be considered digital revenue and how much it should account for.

The article discusses the challenges of measuring revenue in the Metaverse economy, including issues related to digital revenue subsets and device usage. There is ambiguity about how to allocate revenue between different subsets, such as mobile and internet revenues, and how to measure the value of digital updates or device usage. Additionally, there are questions about how to measure revenue for Metaverse-specific products, such as NFTs or virtual world engagements. These challenges highlight the need for a standardized methodology for measuring revenue in the Metaverse economy.

The article discusses questions related to measuring the Metaverse economy, including the interoperability threshold for virtual goods, the portion of subscription fees that fall under Metaverse, and the expenses for operating digital buildings. While there is no single answer to these questions, the practical approach to sizing the Metaverse economy is to view it as a philosophical extension of the digital economy, which has grown steadily over the past few decades. The growth of the digital economy was driven by the proliferation of PCs, internet service, mobile, and cloud, which enabled digital businesses, content, and services to be accessed by more people in more places.

The Metaverse is expected to follow a similar pattern as other digital industries in terms of growth and impact on the global economy. It may contribute a significant portion of the growth in the digital economy and overall GDP, potentially reaching a value of trillions of dollars. Companies that pioneer in the Metaverse may experience faster growth and redefine business models, and may be highly valued by investors, generating substantial wealth.

The digital economy is more significant than its reported revenue, with most of the remaining 80% being digitally informed or powered. The big five tech giants have a disproportionate impact and control over other revenues, even if they don't report them. In the Metaverse era, countless new companies will emerge, and some will displace today's leaders. Some displaced giants will expand or grow their core businesses, while others will perish or decline. The companies that lead in the Metaverse era will become critical intermediaries, potentially becoming multi-trillion-dollar companies.

Facebook faces challenges in its shift towards the Metaverse, including regulatory constraints and negative reputation. Despite this, the company has a significant user base, a large investment in Metaverse initiatives, a head start in VR hardware, and a CEO committed to the Metaverse. However, success in the Metaverse is not guaranteed, as disruptions are unpredictable, and there are many open questions regarding technological advances, monetization models, and new use cases. Microsoft's past failures in predicting technological trends serve as a cautionary tale.

Microsoft shed its attachments to its own stacks and suites to support what the customer preferred, which made it valuable today. Google dominates many categories but has no virtual worlds, platforms, or engines of its own. Niantic and Planet Labs were both spun out of Google, and Google shut down its cloud game-streaming service, Stadia, in 2021. Disruptors such as Epic Games, Unity, and Roblox Corporation have the potential to be leaders in the Metaverse due to their player networks, developer networks, virtual worlds, and virtual plumbing. GAFAM has mostly concerned itself with Office suites in the past decade and a half.

Tech giants have focused on other bets like streaming TV, social and live video, data centers, and cloud-based word processors, but comparatively little attention has been paid to video games despite their potential as a pathway to the Metaverse. Even though Facebook and its competitors had missed the opportunity to acquire Epic, Unity, or Roblox, which spent most of the last decade valued at low-single-digit billions, they were not acquired due to their uncertain role and potential. Zuckerberg had pitched his board on acquiring Unity in 2015, but there were no official bids. The challenges of preparing for and predicting a shift to a new era are emblematic of the relative disregard for gaming.

Unity, Epic, and Roblox could have been acquired cheaply by Facebook and its competitors, but the video games domain was considered niche or uncertain. Facebook's Metaverse strategy revolves around the Roblox and Fortnite-like Horizon Worlds integrated virtual world platform built on Unity, rather than Oculus VR. Amazon Web Services has a significant share of the cloud infrastructure market but has been less successful in building Metaverse-specific content and services. Amazon Game Studios, which focused on Jeff Bezos's goal of making computationally ridiculous games, ended up cancelling most of its titles before release, and New World's monthly player count is estimated in the low millions.

Amazon's gaming division has had limited success despite investing billions in other entertainment divisions. Lost Ark was republished by Amazon, but not developed by them. Amazon Music, Prime Video, and MGM acquisition have received more investment than gaming. Luna, Amazon's cloud game-streaming service, had limited success and the development of Lumberyard, a game engine, was unsuccessful. Amazon may have more success in AR or VR hardware, but its gaming division has yet to make a significant impact.

Apple's hardware, operating system, and app platform will make it a key player in the Metaverse, but it may not develop its own IVWP. Microsoft's gaming division was once considered a distraction, but has become an essential part of the company's strategy. Its acquisition of Minecraft has been successful, and the title's playerbase has grown significantly.

Microsoft is positioning itself well for the metaverse through platform-agnostic products and collaborations, including gaming experiences like Microsoft Flight Simulator and the recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Sony Interactive Entertainment is the largest gaming company in the world by revenue.

Sony has a diverse portfolio of businesses, including gaming hardware and content, movies and TV, semiconductor, visual effects and animation, music, and anime streaming. The PlayStation is a top-selling console, and Sony has strong creative capabilities, but faces challenges in producing hit mobile, cross-platform, or multiplayer games and lags behind in online services and virtual production.

Sony's shift towards the Metaverse may require the use of GAFAM services and products as the company lacks a strong presence in semiconductors. Sony's previous attempts at user-generated content platforms, such as Dreams, have been unsuccessful due to limited availability, cost, and revenue sharing for developers. Sony's smaller reach and R&D budget compared to GAFAM pose challenges for leading in the Metaverse. The company must prioritize innovation and cross-division collaboration, as well as connect to third-party platforms. Nvidia, with its expertise in graphics-based computing, is a potential contender in the Metaverse. Sony's past missed opportunities in various industries highlight the need for successful adaptation and innovation in the Metaverse.

AMD and Nvidia will benefit from increased demand for compute in the Metaverse. Nvidia's cloud game-streaming service and Omniverse platform position the company as a potential leader in the Metaverse. Companies with many advantages may falter in the Metaverse, while small and unknown companies may emerge as leaders. The next generation of creators may displace at least one member of the GAFAM five in the Metaverse.

- The most likely outcome for the Metaverse is a handful of integrated platforms dominating its resources and revenues. - These platforms will shape both the Metaverse and real-world economies and behaviors. - Feedback loops will benefit businesses in the Metaverse, and habits are sticky. - The war for the Metaverse is between centralization and decentralization, and its position will shift over time. - Apple's success in creating a closed mobile ecosystem in 2007 has led to a larger and more mature digital economy.

- Apple's dominance in the personal computer and software sales market deprives developers and consumers of choice. - The growth of the Metaverse benefits from both centralization and decentralization. - Policy approaches need to find a middle ground between centralization and decentralization. - Unreal's license to developers gives them indefinite rights to a specific Unreal Engine build, allowing developers to not be reliant on Epic's whims and leadership.

Epic grants developers freedom to customize and integrate third-party tools, and can choose to forego future updates by building their own. Epic gave up the right to terminate licenses without legal action for unpaid fees or violations, to build trust with developers. The potential for arbitrary bans and revocation of property in the Metaverse can be addressed through decentralization or extending real-world legal systems. Tim Sweeney argues against powerful companies acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the Metaverse, and hopes for a race to trust. Major platforms invest in making it easier and faster to build virtual goods and spaces while showing renewed interest in building trust.

Microsoft's policies aim to earn trust as a partner by reducing fees and allowing non-gaming apps to use their own billing solutions. They updated their Edge browser to allow users to play competitors' cloud game-streaming services and announced a new policy platform for Windows and game marketplaces. This includes supporting third-party payment solutions and app stores, allowing users to set alternatives as default options, and allowing developers to communicate directly with end-users. Some principles may not apply immediately to the current Xbox console store, but Microsoft hopes to generate cumulative profit through customer loyalty.

Microsoft plans to adapt its business model for its Xbox console store, acknowledging the need to close the gap on principles over time. Facebook's Metaverse strategy aims to support developers and maximize the economy of the Metaverse, with policy commitments that benefit developers by marginalizing the power and profits of Facebook's VR and AR devices. These commitments include allowing users to download apps directly from developers or competing app stores, no longer requiring a Facebook account for Oculus devices, and using open-source API collections for browser-based and installed AR and VR apps. Additionally, Facebook has enabled APIs and integrations with competing platforms that were once supported but had been closed for several years.

Microsoft's president Brad Smith endorsed a bill requiring Apple and Google to open up their mobile operating systems to third-party app stores and payment services, citing the importance of promoting competition, fairness, and innovation. If Microsoft and Facebook had succeeded in mobile and gaming, respectively, they may not have changed their views on openness. However, the Web3 movement reflects dissatisfaction with the last 20 years of digital apps, platforms, and ecosystems, which have been built on users' free data. These companies effectively own the data in perpetuity, making it difficult for users to use it elsewhere.



 Amazon's advantage over competitors due to its extensive user data makes it difficult for upstart companies to compete. Many argue that users should have the right to export their data to competing sites. Companies that use user data have negative impacts on users' lives. Facebook's name change to Meta has received criticism due to concerns over big tech's power and influence. The terms Web3 and Metaverse have been conflated, leading to fears over corporate control of virtual worlds. The dystopian themes of science fiction involving virtual worlds stem from the potential for absolute power and corruption by those who control them.



The impact of the Metaverse on society and the need for policy considerations. Major companies could have acquired Epic, Roblox, or Unity, making them worth more than their parent company. Sony partnered with Microsoft for cloud gaming, while Xbox sees Amazon and Google as main competitors. Dreams being limited to PlayStation devices makes it technically powerful, but difficult to expand to other platforms. The digital era has improved access to information and empowered marginalized groups.

The internet has brought about many benefits, but we still face challenges in our online lives such as misinformation, harassment, and limited data rights. These problems are human and societal at their core and have grown with time. As more aspects of our lives move online, these challenges will only increase, especially with the rise of the Metaverse. While the benefits of the internet will continue to grow, our unsolved socio-technological challenges will also worsen and become more difficult to address.

The Metaverse may make radicalization, misinformation, and harassment easier and more difficult to monitor. Decentralization could also make moderation more difficult. Strategies to minimize Metaverse abuse include users giving explicit levels of permission to interact in given spaces and platforms automatically blocking certain capabilities. However, novel forms of harassment are likely to emerge, and the question of data rights and usage remains a concern.

The Metaverse raises questions about personal data, its ownership, and its management. It also has the potential to change the nature of work and labor markets, enabling virtual experiences and remote work opportunities. However, there are many unknowns and challenges to be addressed, including privacy, security, and the fair distribution of benefits.

The Metaverse raises questions about labor rights, including hiring practices and minimum wage laws, as virtual work becomes a larger part of the economy. Identity is also a concern, as avatars may reveal different aspects of oneself or perpetuate cultural appropriation. The recent controversy surrounding the Cryptopunks NFT collection illustrates these issues.

White Cryptopunks are disproportionately low in number, causing a price discount for non-white Cryptopunks. Some argue the discount makes them more affordable, while others express concerns about the digital divide and virtual isolation. Similar worries were expressed a decade ago about superpowered mobile devices exacerbating inequality, but declining costs and expanding utility have addressed those concerns. Consumer electronics typically begin as toys for the wealthy but early sales enable more investment, leading to cost improvements and greater sales.

VR and AR headsets will follow the trend of consumer electronics, leading to greater production efficiency and lower prices. Concerns about spending all time indoors on VR lack context as people already spend a significant amount of time watching video alone. The Metaverse may offer positive outcomes, particularly for the elderly. Governing the Metaverse is difficult due to its unpredictability, but users have agency in deciding who builds it and how it is governed. Some advocate for a larger governmental role in the Metaverse.

The lack of governing bodies beyond virtual world platform operators and service providers is a challenge for the Metaverse. The importance of nonprofit bodies like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in steering internet standards is highlighted, and the idea of a role for government in the development of technology is discussed. The Metaverse presents an opportunity for new rules, standards, and governing bodies, as well as new expectations for those governing bodies. The author is cautious and modest in their suggestions for what these policies should look like.

The author provides a framework for issues related to the Metaverse, but acknowledges that others may have greater expertise on certain topics. Governments are focused on whether Apple and Google should have unilateral control over in-app billing policies and the right to block competing payment services, but payments are just one of many levers platforms use to assert control. Regulators should force platforms to unbundle identity, software distribution, APIs, and entitlements from their hardware and operating systems, so users can own their online identity and the software they purchase, and developers can choose how their software is distributed. Ultimately, users and developers should be able to determine which standards and emerging technologies are best.

Unbundling OS-centric companies would promote fair competition, and developers building on independent game engines, virtual worlds, and app stores need greater protection. Legislative and judicial processes need to be involved in deciding the laws for virtual assets, virtual tenancy, and virtual communities, as relying on for-profit corporations' altruism may not be enough. Governments need to take the economy of the Metaverse seriously and enact policies to support developers who want to export environments, assets, and experiences. Online content platforms do not need to own users' content to build a successful business.

The ease with which content creators can move between online platforms forces them to innovate and encourages competition. Social platforms have shifted towards original programming and creator funds, but the dynamics don't easily carry over to Integrated Virtual World Platforms (IVWPs). Content made on IVWPs is typically unique to that platform and cannot be easily exported or repurposed. This creates a need for policies regarding the exportation of IVWP content.

The differences between Internet Value-Added Web Platforms (IVWPs) and traditional content platforms can have significant consequences for developers, making it harder for them to operate across multiple IVWPs and limiting their reach. This could lead to dominant IVWPs engaging in rent-seeking behavior and developers being less likely to support new IVWPs. Some IVWPs allow selective exports, but the data may not be easily usable and is at the discretion of the platform.

Governments have a responsibility to regulate and shape the standards of the Metaverse by setting export conventions, file types, and data structures for IVWPs. The goal should be to make it easy to transfer virtual environments from one platform to another. Such regulations are necessary to maintain a market that is collectively prosperous and able to produce new leaders. Smart contracts and DAOs should also be legally supported in the Metaverse. The current ultimate authority of platforms like Apple is not a reliable foundation for the digital economy or the Metaverse.

The legal recognition of blockchain technology can promote entrepreneurship, protect against exploitation, and encourage wider usage. KYC regulations should be expanded for cryptocurrency investments, wallets, and transactions to validate customer identity and legal status. Government should take a more serious approach to data collection, usage, rights, and penalties given the extraordinary amount of data that will be generated by Metaverse-focused platforms.

Regulators should establish clear rules for the Metaverse, including user data privacy and security standards. Governments should dictate standards for user data deletion and transferability. Oversight mechanisms for data breaches and corporate negligence should be formalized, and fines should be increased. The internet has become increasingly regionalized, and the same may happen to the Metaverse.

The emergence of the Metaverse is likely to lead to more and stronger regional players. Nation-specific regulations are causing fragmentation in the modern internet, resulting in different internets in various countries. As governments regulate the Metaverse and try to reduce the power of Web 2.0 leaders, the world will end up with different Metaverses. The South Korean Metaverse Alliance aims to build a stronger Metaverse economy in South Korea and increase their global presence. The Chinese Metaverse is expected to be more centrally controlled and arrive earlier than the Western nations, with Tencent being a significant player.

Tencent is a significant player in the gaming industry, releasing titles of major companies and developing local versions of popular games. They own a significant stake in Epic Games, Sea Limited, and Krafton, and wholly own and operate WeChat and QQ, the most popular messaging apps in China. Tencent is well-positioned to facilitate the interoperation of user data, virtual worlds, identity, and payments and influence Metaverse standards. The Metaverse's realization is dependent on physical hardware, computer processors, and networks. The book concludes with the observation that technology produces surprises, and while Vannevar Bush predicted the devices of the future and their crucial role, his Memex was limited to the desk.



 The Memex envisioned a device for storing and connecting all user content, but today's computers only resemble it in spirit. 

 Science fiction has influenced technology development, but not always in the ways predicted. 

 The future will increasingly revolve around real-time 3D virtual worlds, with improved network capabilities and greater computing power. 

 Younger generations will adopt the Metaverse more than their parents, and a few companies will control a substantial share of the digital economy. 

 Regulators will try to monitor these companies but may fall short, and some category leaders in the Metaverse will be different from those we know.



 Some leaders in the digital and mobile product market will be displaced, while others will survive or even grow. 

 Real-time 3D rendering won't be the best option for all tasks or content, and achieving interoperability will be slow and imperfect. 

 Various virtual worlds and platforms will open up slowly, taking different approaches to data and user exchange. 

 The role of blockchain in the Metaverse's future is unclear, with differing opinions and limited success so far.

The Metaverse will arrive and be worth trillions by the end of the decade, but the exact timing and revenue remain uncertain. The hype cycle will be caused by companies over-promising Metaverse experiences, technical barriers, and uncertainty about what companies should build. Metaverse apps will be in the early stage of development initially, but gradually, everything we do will be reinvented.

The Metaverse will feel significant when it becomes a practical reality, but technology and imagination are constraints on its development. The fits and bursts of Metaverse development will lead to critiques and bouts of disappointment. Criticisms of the Metaverse resemble those of the internet when it was new and faced skepticism.

The NASDAQ has surpassed its dotcom-era high and the future is unpredictable. The development of the internet and the iPhone App Store are examples of how technological breakthroughs lead to unforeseen changes. The Metaverse is expected to follow a similar trajectory. Consumers, developers, and entrepreneurs respond to technological breakthroughs, and things that seem trivial can become essential and change the world in ways both predicted and unexpected.
