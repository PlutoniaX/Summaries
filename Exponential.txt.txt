The author recalls the evolution of personal computers from the ZX81 in the 1980s, which was capable of basic functions and simple programming, to the Acorn BBC Master with more advanced capabilities such as spreadsheets and games. The computer industry underwent consolidation in the 1990s with Microsoft and Intel emerging as dominant players.

The relationship between Intel and Microsoft resulted in improved computer performance, with each generation of software requiring more computational power from Intel. The author purchased a PC clone with an Intel 80486 processor, 4 MB of RAM, and improved graphics. This 10-year journey reflected a period of exponential improvement in computer technology.

Computers have undergone a rapid transformation due to progress in the computing industry, with computers becoming millions of times more capable in just a decade. This transformation was made possible by representing logic as a series of binaries, which evolved from clumsy mechanical parts to electronic circuits that utilize Boolean logic. The discovery of the transistor by Bell Labs in 1947 paved the way for useful switches made of semiconductors, which could be used to build logic gates for elementary logic.

The invention of the transistor in 1947 paved the way for smaller and more reliable electronic components and led to the development of more sophisticated computers. In 1960, the first integrated circuit was developed, which combined several transistors into a single component through photolithography. The physical area of integrated circuits was reducing by about 50% every year, without any decrease in the number of transistors, leading to improved performance and reduced costs. Gordon Moore was one of the first people to understand the power of this technology.

Moore's Law, postulated by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965, predicted that the effective speed of a chip would double every 18-24 months for the same cost due to advancements in technology and tighter packing. While not a predictive law like those in physics, it became a social fact and objective for the computer industry. The industry worked to make it hold true, and it has been a good guide to progress in computers. The growth of transistors per microchip has followed an exponential curve, resulting in significant advancements in computing power.

Advancements in technology and tighter packing have resulted in a nearly 10 million times increase in the number of transistors per chip between 1971 and 2015. The cost of a transistor has dropped significantly, driving the computing revolution and making computers much faster and cheaper. The number of transistors in devices like smartphones is now in the billions, and computers have become a part of everyday life. The growth in computing power has been remarkable, with the number of computers increasing from 264 in the 1950s to billions today.

There are over 5 billion computing devices in use, and computers have been getting faster and more powerful due to the exponential growth of technology. Exponential growth means that an increase compounds consistently over time, resulting in a rapid increase in value. This phenomenon is not limited to technology and can be observed in natural processes like the spread of viruses or bacteria. The emergence of exponential technologies is defined as the ability for technology to improve at a rate of over 10% per year for several decades at a fixed cost.

For a technology to be exponential, it must improve at a compounding rate of over 10% per year for several decades, resulting in significant increases in power and decreases in cost. This is different from short-lived trends. The diesel engine is not an exponential technology as its improvements slowed down, while computer chips have improved by roughly 50% annually for five decades. Technologies discussed in the book can improve at rates of 20 to 50% per year, resulting in a sixfold to 60-fold increase in capability over a decade for the same price.



As the price of technology drops, it becomes more accessible and its capabilities explode, leading to continually cheaper products that can do genuinely new things.

Horace Dediu, a business analyst, has analyzed historical data over the last two decades to examine how quickly technologies spread through the American economy.

He tracks a broad range of innovations, and for each, he establishes how long it took to reach 75% market penetration.



The spread of most technologies follows an S-curve, with slow uptake at first followed by rapid acceleration until market saturation is reached.

The process of market saturation has been getting faster for decades, especially with exponential technologies.

The increasing rate of change in technology adoption has been noticeable over the twentieth century.

Technologies today scale and diffuse at a faster rate than ever before, with digital technology being the fastest. Products roll out faster and saturate quicker, with social media taking 14% of a lifespan to achieve saturation. Benchmarked against the average lifespan at the time of introduction, smartphones diffused 12.5 times faster than the original telephone. Exponential technologies of our time, underpinned by growing computing power, found their way into three-quarters of American homes within 8-15 years, compared to the early twentieth century's defining technologies which took over 30 years to reach the same milestone. The pace with which technologies scale is constantly increasing.

The exponential spread of technology has accelerated in the last decade or two, exemplified by the speed with which Facebook and Lime grew their user base. Facebook amassed its first million users in just 15 months and had 2.5 billion users at the end of 2019, while Lime served 1 million rides in just six months and 10 million in seven months. The growth of digital technologies is not limited to the US, as seen with KakaoTalk's launch of a bank in Korea, which saw 2 million Koreans open accounts within two weeks. This rapid growth is made possible by the revolution in computing and falling prices.

The exponential growth in digital technology is driven by Moore's Law, leading to constantly increasing computing power and decreasing prices. New products can spread faster, leading to constant acceleration. However, the slowdown of Moore's Law is being noticed, and the current approach to chip design is close to its limits.

The semiconductor industry has heavily invested in meeting Moore's Law, which has led to the need for sophisticated and expensive laser technology and cleanroom environments. The growth of transistors per chip has slowed due to increased heat and quantum physics, but the growth of computing power is expected to continue.

Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns explains the exponential pace of technological development due to a positive feedback loop where each generation of technology builds on the previous ones. Kurzweil's insight is that the exponential development is not just about individual inventions or sectors, but the interaction of multiple technologies following S-curves. As one S-curve flattens out, a younger technology takes up the mantle of rapid growth, leading to a continuous acceleration of technological progress.

Different technologies inspire and nourish each other, leading to a quickening pace of technological progression even as the development of individual technologies slows down. The theory suggests that we will always find new approaches to meet the growing demands of users. The development of artificial intelligence has broken through the limits of chip design and opened up new possibilities for computing power. AI can be considered intelligent if it can make decisions to achieve its objectives. Researchers have been working on building such intelligent machines for the past 60 years.

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) progressed slowly due to a lack of data and computing power. Machine learning, which involves gathering massive amounts of information and using algorithms to identify patterns, was seen as the most promising approach. However, until recently, the required data and computing power did not exist. In the early 2010s, there was suddenly a large amount of data available thanks to people sharing photos on the internet. Fei-Fei Li, a computer scientist specializing in the intersection of neuroscience and computer science, set up ImageNet in 2009 to digitally map out as many real-world objects as possible. ImageNet contained 14,197,122 images hand-annotated with tags, and it catalyzed the explosion of useful AI.

Thanks to ImageNet, a dataset of 14 million hand-annotated images, labelled data was in high supply for AI researchers. Computing power also improved enough by 2010 to facilitate deep learning, which involves creating layers of artificial neurons modeled on human brains. In 2012, a team of researchers developed a deep convolutional neural network called AlexNet, which applied deep learning to image-sorting tasks and had a success rate as high as 87%. This sparked an AI feeding frenzy, with scientists rushing to build AI systems for a wide range of applications. Neural networks now require increasing amounts of data and processing power.

The amount of computer power used to train the largest AI models has increased about six times faster than the rate of Moore's Law, with usage increasing 300,000 times between 2012 and 2018. This can be explained by using chips developed for high-end graphics in video games, which proved well-suited for AI due to their ability to perform millions of multiplications needed for neural nets. The computer industry rose to the challenge by building specialist chips for running neural networks at high speeds.

Specialist AI chips are made up of much bigger components than traditional processors, which means computing power is set to grow exponentially for the foreseeable future. If these chips become unsuitable for society's growing demand for computing power, quantum computing is a completely novel approach that can tackle vital problems, such as modelling new kinds of molecules. In one experiment, a prototype quantum computer from Google performed a computing test in 200 seconds that would have taken a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer around 10,000 years.

Advancements in technology are constantly developing, and as one approach reaches its full potential, another will take its place. Computing was the harbinger of the Exponential Age, showing what happens when technologies accelerate, creating entire industries in their wake. However, this acceleration is not limited to computing and is driven by a mix of social, economic, and political forces. The article references a primordial quantum computer that was over 1 billion times faster than its classical rival, and how new alternatives are being developed as we approach the bounds of one approach.

The 1974 James Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun, features a device called the Solex Agitator that can harness solar power, reflecting the anxieties of a world in the grips of an unprecedented oil crisis. At that time, generating any useful amount of electricity from the sun's rays was too expensive, but since then, the cost of photovoltaics has dropped dramatically, making solar power more affordable and accessible.

The cost of solar power has decreased dramatically in the last decade, with the price of electricity generated by solar power declining by 89% from 2010 to 2019, making it the cheapest source of electricity in two-thirds of the world. Exponentiality is not limited to computing but also seen in energy, biology, and manufacturing. The costs of the key technologies in each area are falling dramatically, by the equivalent of a factor of six or more every decade.

The chapter explores exponential change in three other key areas besides computing: energy, biology, and manufacturing. Growing demand, innovation, and networking of information and trade are factors contributing to this transformative impact. The cost of wind power has declined by 70% in the last 10 years, and it is helping to replace other forms of energy production worldwide. The four areas represent a new era of human society, and exponentiality is pervasive in technology across various sectors of the economy.

Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power face limitations due to their intermittency, but the cost of battery storage has been decreasing exponentially, making large-scale battery systems nearly as cheap as coal- and gas-fired power stations. The price of electricity generated by renewables and battery storage is expected to decline even further in the next decade. In the realm of biology, technological progress in biomatter is outpacing that of the energy revolution, but breakthroughs are being made, such as in the complex process of reading the human genome.

The cost of sequencing a full human genome has decreased exponentially, from $500 million for the first draft in 2000 to $100 by 2020, representing a million-fold improvement in less than 20 years. Lower prices have led to higher usage, with humanity sequencing over 200,000 genomes a year in 2015 and an estimated 2 billion human genomes may have been sequenced by 2025. Factors driving down costs include growing computing power and genome sequences becoming easier to read and assemble. The decrease in cost has surpassed even Moore's Law.

Advancements in biotechnology, including DNA sequencing, synthetic biology, and manufacturing, are driving exponential growth in scientific breakthroughs. DNA sequencing has become cheaper due to advancements in chemicals, electronics, and automation. Synthetic biology is creating new biological components and systems that can produce new materials such as biopolymers and electronic components. By 2040, it's estimated that 60% of the physical inputs in the global economy could be produced biologically. Manufacturing is also undergoing transformative changes.

Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a rapidly advancing technology that allows for individual detailing without waste. Unlike subtractive manufacturing, where material is chiseled away, additive manufacturing creates objects by layering melted material using computer-aided design. It marks a fundamental break with traditional manufacturing methods, such as casting and molding. The technology has improved significantly since its inception in the mid-1980s and can work with a range of materials, including plastics, steels, ceramics, and even human proteins. 3D printing has been used to create organs for transplant surgery and is set to transform manufacturing.

A 2,500-square-foot building was 3D-printed in 17 days using 75% less concrete than typical designs, with exponential growth projected in the additive manufacturing sector. The transformation of computing, biology, energy, and manufacturing through innovation in these four domains is significant, as not all technologies are equal, and exponential growth is expected to bring about a 14-fold improvement in performance and a drop in prices over the next 10 years.

General purpose technologies (GPTs) have a broad impact and create opportunities for complementary products and services, transforming societies beyond recognition. GPTs change almost everything in a society, by creating an agenda for the creation of new products, processes, and organizational forms. They have effects beyond any one sector and can force changes to the urban environment, reshaping consumer practices. The car is a key GPT from the start of the 20th century that transformed society through infrastructure, fuel stations, and changes to the urban environment.

The emergence of transformative General Purpose Technologies (GPTs) in the domains of computing, energy, biology, and manufacturing is bringing about an exponential revolution. These GPTs have a wide range of potential uses, but their revolutionary effects may take time to materialize as new infrastructure is built and companies train their employees in novel techniques. GPTs are integrated into the economy in a series of steps, starting with the installation phase when the basic infrastructure is developed.

The deployment phase is the stage when economies have rolled out enough of a new technology to make it useful, and societies can enjoy its benefits. This is a golden age, but it takes time to get there, as it requires building up the requisite knowledge and experience to make use of the technology. However, the deployment phase may come faster than in previous eras due to the faster rate of technology deployment. Our age is defined by the cascading of technologies, with one new technology leading rapidly to the next. The computing revolution made the creation and processing of information much easier, leading to a transformation of corporate organization and the rise of products that could target increasingly small niches.

The rise of computers, followed by the spread of the PC and the internet, and then the smartphone, has led to significant transformations in many parts of the economy. The smartphone has replaced many other consumer devices and changed the way people shop, leading to a shift towards online shopping. These innovations have been driven by GPTs, which continue to spread and transform various aspects of daily life. The GPTs of the Exponential Age are just beginning to emerge.

The transformative impact of exponential technology is driven by three forces, with the first being "learning by doing." The limitations of Moore's Law are discussed, and it is noted that human behavior is key to technological change. The question of why now is raised, with the rise of new technologies such as cheap power, bioengineering, and 3D printing. The transformative effects of these technologies are yet to be fully realized.

Wright's Law, developed by Theodore Wright, states that for every doubling in units produced, costs will fall by a constant percentage (learning rate), due to engineers learning by doing and finding more efficient ways to build a product. The continuation of Wright's Law relies on increasing volume, which drives improvements in the process, lowering costs, and increasing demand. This law could provide a better approach to predicting technological change, applicable to various technologies.

Wright's Law focuses on the relationship between demand and skill, stating that as demand for a product grows, the people producing it have more opportunities to learn by doing, which drives costs down. This law applies to various technologies and holds true for hallmark technologies of the Exponential Age, such as lithium-ion batteries. Wright's Law predicts the declining cost of these batteries due to increased demand and volume. In contrast to economies of scale, Wright's Law could provide a better approach to predicting technological change.

Wright's Law, which accurately describes the decrease in prices of products, including silicon chips, has had clear limits in the past as the market saturates. However, in today's economy, the limits to Wright's Law seem more distant, and in some cases, they might not exist at all, as prices of new technologies such as USB sticks continue to drop endlessly without slowing down. This is partly due to the physical nature of the underlying technologies.

Exponential gains in the efficiency and output of technologies such as silicon chips and wind turbines are due to the square-law effect, where making components smaller leads to a squared efficiency gain. The newfound power of Wright's Law is mainly due to the distant saturation point of the global market for products, which allows the process explained by Wright's Law to continue for much longer, leading to more demand and more efficient production. The volume of world trade has increased significantly in the last 50 years, pushing us further down the path of Wright's Law.

- Wright's Law describes how technological progress leads to cheaper goods and bigger markets, creating an inherently exponential cycle. - The combination of general purpose technologies in novel and powerful ways is driving exponential growth. - Energy Vault is an example of combinatorial invention, using insect-like cranes and reconstituted building rubble to create a huge electricity storage system that can power homes and cars.

- Energy Vault's crane-block battery relies on a combination of four well-understood technologies and an automated machine vision system using deep learning, which controls the cranes and lifting of the blocks. - Technologies have always combined, but contemporary technologies are more prone to combination due to standardization and the ability to use standard components in different compound products. - Combination at scale drives innovation and the emergence of new breakthroughs that rely on aspects of technologies that went before.

Standardization, developed from the bottom up, has been crucial for technological advancements. International standards bodies have played a key role in developing consensus around simple and complex things. However, the most important standards have been developed by people who created new technologies. The internet, built on standards developed by academic researchers, is a prime example of this. Internet standards allow for seamless communication between individuals.

Standardization enables interoperability and makes the world more efficient, allowing for the combination and recombination of technologies, which catalyzes further innovation. The story of the author's failed attempt to get regular satellite photographs of major ports for economic insights highlights the transformative effects of recent standardization. Today, it would be trivial and cheap to obtain such images, which are used by hedge funds and commodities traders to estimate customer demand and assess the performance of the retail sector.

Standardization has led to the rise of a new generation of affordable satellites, with over 2,000 operational satellites as of 2018. In software, standardization has given rise to componentization, allowing developers to use easy-to-access lumps of code and combine them to create new technologies. This shift in technological development has resulted in the emergence of new technologies through the combination and recombination of existing components.

Laura O'Sullivan, a high school student in Cork, Ireland, developed an automated system to detect anomalies in cervical smears using breakthroughs in machine vision. With rudimentary coding experience, Laura used open-source data from a hospital in Denmark to build and fine-tune convolutional neural networks, addressing issues caused by unbalanced data sets using generative adversarial networks (GANs). The technique she used allowed the algorithms to learn effectively and create a robust data set.

The proliferation of networks, including networks of information, has driven the exponential development and spread of technology. An example of this is the case of a teenager who developed a software using a GAN downloaded for free from GitHub, which was better than a human doctor at identifying anomalies in images. These networks have changed the nature of trade, invention, science, relationships, disease, finance, information, and threats. Informational networks have been developing for decades, and the expansion of the internet in the 1990s has contributed to this development.

The creation of arXiv, a centralised system for preprints, has revolutionised the distribution of scientific knowledge and ignited the open access movement. The availability of good-quality papers on arXiv has widened the groups who can participate in the scientific process. This phenomenon has expanded to other domains, and around 50 preprint services now work to accelerate the diffusion of academic knowledge. These preprint servers remove the boundaries to academic research and let ordinary people access cutting-edge ideas for free.

The coronavirus pandemic led to a rapid increase in the number of academic papers on Covid available on preprint servers and other open-access sources. Preprint servers and other information networks facilitate collaboration and the spread of ideas, leading to breakthrough technologies. The internet distributes ideas worldwide, while shipping containers revolutionized the shipping industry in the 1950s by making it faster, cheaper, and more efficient.

Standardization of shipping containers revolutionized the shipping industry, allowing for more efficient handling and transport. Container ships grew in size, reducing the cost of doing business globally and enabling the just-in-time supply chain. The combination of shipping technologies, e-commerce, and computerized ordering systems made logistics increasingly efficient. Companies like Apple hold very little inventory, relying on just-in-time production and shipping.

The digital and physical networks of the internet and shipping have contributed to the spread of new technologies and are the third engine of the Exponential Age. Exponential technologies are driven by the power of learning by doing, increasing interaction and combination of new technologies, and new networks of information and trade. These driving forces are also influenced by shifts in politics and economics, particularly globalization, as they are intertwined.

The origins of exponential change and globalization can be traced beyond technology to the emergence of a new political orthodoxy in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where economists began shaping public policy. The toxic combination of low growth and high inflation led to the emergence of a new school of economics, led by Milton Friedman, that advocated for rolling back regulations and cutting taxes to unleash the power of the market. This market-friendly ideology was embraced by policymakers and contributed to the emergence of globalization.

The emergence of free-market capitalism in the late 1970s, which prioritized the power of markets over the state, helped drive globalization and unleashed a wave of entrepreneurialism, laying the foundations for the transition to the Exponential Age. The relationship between the political orthodoxy and exponential technologies is important to understand, as the two were interconnected. However, giving an exact date for the start of the Exponential Age is difficult.

Exponential change is a continual, smooth curve without sharp, disjointed moments. The tipping point for the exponential technology that transformed everything came in the second decade of the 21st century, with the widespread adoption of smartphones, the global drop in solar energy costs, and the rise of digital technology companies like Apple, Tencent, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. This point B in the exponential curve was not reached until sometime after the 1990s, despite the development of the internet and microprocessor in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The Exponential Age is a time when technology and its effects are a defining force in society, with technologies developing rapidly and transforming every area of our lives. The disruptive power of this age lies in the way humans respond to the exponential change. Amazon's success is driven by its annual research and development budget of $36 billion, which leaves other companies and many governments behind, and is used to develop everything from robots to smart home assistants.

Amazon's annual R&D budget of $36 billion in 2019, which has grown rapidly over the past decade, creates a chasm between traditional linear thinking and the Exponential Age. The exponential gap is the divergence between technologies that develop at an exponential pace and the ideas and norms of the old world that can only adapt incrementally. Companies, institutions, and communities that cannot keep up with the exponential pace get left behind.

In the Exponential Age, a primary input for companies is their ability to process information, and one of the main costs to process data is computation, which has rapidly declined every couple of years due to Moore's Law. Companies that understand and plan for this deflation become well-positioned to take advantage of the Exponential Age, as exemplified by early adopters such as Amazon, Uber, Alibaba, Spotify, and TikTok.

Companies that understand and adapt to exponential technology shifts become successful, while those that don't, like much of the newspaper publishing industry, fail. Exponential change starts off looking humdrum and is ignored, but at some point, it crosses the line of linear change and reaches an inflection point, which is hard to fathom for institutions that follow a linear trajectory. The gap between institutions' capacity to change and new technologies' accelerating speed is the defining consequence of the shift into the Exponential Age.

The "exponential gap" refers to the tension between evolving technologies and the outdated norms that govern them, leading to uncertainty and conflict in areas such as the economy, work, and privacy. New technologies challenge traditional societal norms and regulations, creating a dissonance between potential benefits and negative consequences.

The "exponential gap" is caused by human difficulty in processing rapid technological change, which leads to tension between evolving technology and outdated societal norms. This difficulty in processing exponential change is illustrated through a thought experiment involving exponential rain at a soccer stadium, which highlights the need for timely action to avoid being overwhelmed by the rapid increase in raindrops.

Exponential processes are counterintuitive and difficult to understand, as shown by the example of rain and Thomas Malthus' predictions about population growth. The modern environmental movement began to develop in the late 1960s, harking back to Malthus' warnings and driven by concern that increasing resource consumption would destroy our biosphere. The groundbreaking tract The Limits to Growth argued that exponential patterns in the rate of resource usage would become fundamentally unsustainable.

People are hopeless at understanding exponential growth, as evidenced by research in various fields, including psychology and finance. The exponential growth bias and anchoring bias are related phenomena that make people consistently underestimate the future size of something growing at a compounded rate. This blind spot persists even with daily experience with growing processes. This has implications for predicting accelerating changes, particularly with regards to exponential technology improvements.

People tend to anchor their expectations around a readily available number when faced with a numerical challenge, but this strategy fails with exponential growth. Humans tend to underestimate the power of exponential change due to the linear mentality developed from living in a world of slow, repeated patterns throughout the year. This slow pace defined human existence until recently, making it difficult to adapt to a faster pace of life. The spread of pandemics follows exponential growth, which is an exception to this linear mentality.

Humans have evolved to deal with a linear world and are not well-equipped to deal with exponential change. This creates challenges when predicting the growth of new technologies or products. People tend to dismiss new products when the absolute numbers are small, even if signs of hockey stick growth are present. For example, in the early 1980s, McKinsey predicted that the US mobile phone market would approach 900,000 subscribers by 2000, but the actual number was much higher.

The cost of mobile phones and data services have significantly decreased over the years due to advancements in technology and growing network capabilities. McKinsey predicted that by the year 2000, only one million Americans would own a mobile phone, but over 100 million did. Predicting the future is challenging, as demonstrated by the International Energy Agency's inaccurate predictions regarding solar power generation.

The International Energy Agency made inaccurate predictions about the amount of electricity generated by solar power, underestimating the growth by several gigawatts. The experts systematically misread the market for six years straight, continuing to overestimate its power. Ray Kurzweil's prediction that a $1,000 computer would be equivalent to the computational ability of the human brain by 2019 proved optimistic. A slight error in basic assumptions can throw off predictions when trying to square rapid, exponential growth with complex issues.

Making accurate predictions about exponential growth and its impact can be challenging as unforeseen consequences and technical difficulties often arise. Self-driving car companies have missed their targets as the problem is much harder than anticipated. Unforeseen consequences can have unexpected effects, such as the fall in chewing gum sales due to the increased use of smartphones. Predicting the impact of exponential growth, such as the spread of Covid-19, can also be challenging.

Exponential growth, such as the spread of Covid-19, is often difficult to grasp, and predictions tend to be inaccurate due to exponential growth bias. Our failure to predict the cadence of exponential change and adapt to it is a secondary cause of the exponential gap. As the speed of change increases, our society remoulds itself at a much slower pace, and our institutions have an inbuilt tendency towards incrementalism. This is a key consequence of innovation, as seen in the 19th century when breakthroughs in industrial machinery led to a period where workers' wages remained stagnant despite rapid GDP growth.

The Industrial Revolution led to increased wealth and improved quality of life, but the transition to factories caused many workers to experience longer working hours and poor living conditions. Charles Dickens wrote about the exploitation and misery of industrial towns, and even earlier, in 1814, British poet Robert Southey described the working conditions in Birmingham as "infernal." It took decades for wages to catch up to the growth driven by technology.

Industrialisation brought about wretched living conditions for workers in factories, with the noise and filth of urban life being particularly unbearable. The institutional and political adaptation was slow, and the regulation of factories only began with the 1833 Factory Act. Today, institutions face the challenge of keeping up with rapidly changing technologies, but the pace of change is much faster than before.

Institutions are more than just buildings and refer to the systems that govern our lives and relationships. They provide stability and can take various forms, including formal organizations like businesses, states, and international organizations, as well as less formal arrangements like the Rule of Law. Laws and legal systems are important institutions that govern our lives.

Unwritten rules and norms, as well as formal institutions, guide our behavior and provide stability, but they are not well-suited for rapid change or exponential growth. The Catholic Church, one of the oldest institutions, took over 300 years to correct a mistake in its judgment. Most institutions are slow to adapt to change, which can be a challenge in the face of exponential growth or unexpected events.

In the 1970s, Kodak developed an electronic still camera, but failed to capitalize on the opportunity despite having a two-decade head start. The company did eventually enter the digital camera market and recognized the potential of the internet, but their institutional knowledge and focus on their traditional film and print business held them back from creating anything as popular as Instagram. Linking their photo-sharing site to their traditional business was a wrong decision.

Kodak and Microsoft failed to adapt to technological change, leading to their decline. Kodak struggled to pivot its business strategy to focus on digital cameras and photo-sharing online, while Microsoft was slow to recognize the disruptive power of the internet and the potential of the iPhone. The institutional memory and focus on the previous paradigm held back both companies, leading to missed opportunities and eventually decline.

The article discusses how rapid technological advancements can cause companies and institutions to struggle to adapt, leading to missed opportunities and challenges in cultural conventions. Microsoft initially missed opportunities due to resistance to change, but successfully pivoted under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella with the rise of cloud computing. Similarly, legal and political institutions can prove intransigent, as seen in the slow adoption of compensation and liability statutes for workplace accidents. The rise of new technologies also challenges cultural conventions, such as the use of smartphones and video games.

The article explores why institutions, whether social norms or companies, are slow to change, with path dependence being a key factor. Path dependence means practices and customs become determined early on and can have long-lasting effects on behavior. Even when institutions try to change, they tend to remain rooted in what has come before, adapting through layering, drift, or conversion. These tendencies have wide-ranging implications for businesses, governments, and social norms.

The UK's National Health Service's continued use of pagers is an example of institutional layering where new practices and norms are built on top of outdated technology. The institutional slowness of change can be punctuated by events such as wars and revolutions. However, institutions tend to develop slowly without significant impetus.

The exponential gap is the result of the inherent slowness of institutional change and the rapid advancement of technology. In the early years of the computer industry, failing to adapt to new trends had mild consequences, but in the current Exponential Age, it poses an existential threat as technology becomes systematically important. Those who understand and harness the power of exponentiality will do much better than those who don't, and the emergence of a two-tier society is a possibility.

The exponential gap between those who have adopted new technology and those who haven't poses a challenge to social institutions. Slowing down the pace of exponential change is difficult and may not be desirable since many urgent issues can only be addressed with exponential technology. A better approach is to prepare for the acceleration of technology by developing solutions to address the challenges that arise.

To close the exponential gap, we can equip our social institutions to adapt to exponential technology and prepare for rapid change. Developing new ways of organizing society to distribute the benefits of exponential technology evenly is also necessary. The exponential gap is emerging in various sectors, and radical thinking is required to prevent it from eroding society's fabric. The traditional rules of business no longer apply, and new technologies clash with existing systems. Successful companies in the past benefited from economies of scale, but they also encountered forces that held them back.

As companies expand and become more complex, managing them becomes more difficult, and bureaucracy slows decision-making. Organizational costs grow as firms get bigger and come to act as a force of gravity. To escape this problem, firms may develop a narrow specialty, which results in less entrepreneurship and agility. As companies get larger, they become untenably complicated, short-sighted, conservative, and unidimensional. Diminishing marginal returns set in, resulting in a decreasing return for every dollar a company invests. Competitors may be able to chip away at the advantage of the market leader, and dominance becomes hard.

In the Exponential Age, market dominance is becoming more pronounced among certain companies, with Google having an 80-95% market share in search queries, Android being installed on 4 out of 5 phones globally, and Facebook and Google accounting for over 90% of all global spend in online advertising. In more traditional markets, market share remains fragmented, and a dominant market share of over 50-60% is considered problematic and may provoke the ire of the state.

Superstar companies, such as Apple, Google, Uber, and Facebook, dominate markets and transform them, becoming more productive, innovative, and growing faster than traditional firms. They control a significant percentage of the market and create a monopoly in their respective fields. These companies are becoming more common worldwide, and the more digitized an industry is, the more it is prone to superstarification. The top 10% of public companies generate four-fifths of all company profits.

Superstar firms dominate markets due to exponential technologies, which operate differently than industrial-era technologies. The winner takes all in the exponential economy, and the gap between the best and worst firms is greater than ever. Superstardom is achieved by operating in any given market, and massive scale emerges organically. While this may be beneficial for shareholders, it is unclear whether it is good for the economy or society. Capitalism can bring out some of the worst attributes of humanity, and there are rules to govern how firms should operate and pay tax.

The rise of superstar firms highlights a mismatch between their operations and existing norms, rules and conventions. This creates an exponential gap, which is taking over the economy. The emergence of new networks is one of the drivers of this gap, as it benefits superstar firms through the network effect. Any small advantage can turn into a bigger one, while any small slip-up can cause a company to become irrelevant.

The article discusses network externalities and how they can create positive or negative effects. It uses the example of a fax machine to explain how the addition of every new member of the network increases the value of the network for everyone. The article also notes that network effects are why many successful companies, such as Facebook, PayPal, Microsoft, Google, and eBay, are so large.

The network effect drives businesses to ever-bigger gains, making them better and stronger as they get bigger. The success of Microsoft in dominating the operating system market is attributed to the power of the network effect, with its operating system becoming the dominant choice for developers, resulting in more software and hardware choices for users, and a larger user base, perpetuating the cycle.

Microsoft's dominance in the operating system and productivity software markets was attributed to the powerful network effect, making it hard for competitors to break in. The network effect allowed Microsoft to spread from one market area to the next. Similarly, Wikipedia benefits from network externalities, with contributors gathering to share their knowledge and readers congregating on the platform.

The network effect is a positive externality where additional contributors bring in more readers, creating a winner-takes-all market. The World Wide Web benefited from network effects, making it the sole viable information network on the internet. Consumers join the biggest network for the most value. Digital technologies are better placed to take advantage of network effects as they can rely on their customers already accessing a communication network.

Digital technologies and the prevalence of smartphones have created room for a new type of business that can act as a platform, connecting producers to consumers without doing much producing. This shift contrasts with industrial-age companies like Ford, which organized themselves according to their internal linear value chain. Companies like eBay and Facebook act as platforms, offering services that match different types of people, such as sellers with buyers or individuals with each other.

Digital technology has enabled the emergence of massive platforms that bring together buyers and sellers without the limitations of physical marketplaces. The power of these platforms has allowed superstar companies to grow to extraordinary sizes and offer a greater range of choices than any physical marketplace. The rise of these platforms is the second key driver of the rise of superstar companies in the Exponential Age.

Platforms are capital-efficient, as they facilitate exchange without spending much money. Platform executives rely on third parties to provide stock, warehouse, and logistics, making the platform business model ubiquitous and able to creep into any industry. The model has taken hold globally, and even high-value business activities like online medical consultation can be platform-based. The wider ecosystem pays for the logistics and supply chain, not the platform operator.

In the Exponential Age, platforms and network effects lead to the rise of exponential corporations that rely on intangible assets, such as software and data, rather than tangible assets. These companies employ specialists on a platform basis and can quickly become dominant, while traditional companies may struggle to keep up.

The shift from tangible to intangible assets has been remarkable, with intangible assets accounting for 84% of the value of the S&P 500 in 2015. The largest companies rely heavily on intangible assets, which make up 94% of their market value. The value of a product now comes from research and design, branding, and service, rather than the manufacturing process. This shift is caused by factors such as technological advances and changing consumer preferences.

The increasing complexity of products and the growing size of global markets have led to the rise of an intangible economy where know-how is more important than raw materials. Intangible goods are expensive to produce initially, but cheap to copy, which creates winner-takes-all markets. Intangible assets, particularly artificial intelligence, help companies scale rapidly and efficiently.

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in products creates a data network effect, where the AI becomes more effective as it receives more data from users. This perpetual motion cycle leads to more effective and desirable products, which generates more data and further improves the AI. Companies that master this cycle can scale rapidly and efficiently in the Exponential Age, such as Google and Netflix.

The emergence of intangible assets has led to the exponential growth of companies like Google, which are trading in intangibles and can scale easily without worrying about physical expansion. In the exponential economy, network effects are key, and companies can grow exponentially once they gain customers, leaving behind their rivals. This shift towards intangible assets has fundamentally rewired the logic of the global economy, as traditional large companies have stopped growing, while Exponential Age superstars like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba, and Amazon are still growing at an exponential rate. The digital giants' revenues are still growing rapidly, despite their scale.

Superstar companies like Tencent, Amazon, and Facebook have learned to push past the law of diminishing returns to scale, experiencing increasing returns to scale as they get bigger. For example, Salesforce transformed the software industry with the idea of software as a service delivered through a web browser, and has grown from a handful of founders to a $200 billion business with nearly 50,000 employees, making each additional employee more productive and getting more money from customers. These companies have grown at a far quicker rate than the global economy and have inverted one of the basic laws of business.

Salesforce and Netflix demonstrate the dynamics of increasing returns to scale in the Exponential Age economy, where one dominant company can grow exponentially and become a winner-takes-all market. These companies have a winner-takes-all mindset and can grow without taking on many more staff or becoming unwieldy, leading to cultural and societal impact. Salesforce's average customer payment rose sixfold while customer renewal rate increased from 81% to over 90%. Netflix's revenue and employee count grew more than 10 times in a decade, and it now produces more original content than the entire TV industry before 2016.

Businesses based on network effects operate differently to traditional firms, prioritizing large rewards and growth over efficiency. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs emphasize blitzscaling and growth over competition and efficiency, aiming to become the dominant company in their market. The Exponential Age's superstar firms have a winner-takes-all mentality, where second place is a distant second.

The obsession with constant growth is manifested in three ways. The first is horizontal expansion, exemplified by Alibaba's expansion into adjacent markets with the creation of Ant Financial. Ant Financial used transaction data to power its expansion through network effects and increasing returns, leading to the development of a range of businesses, with many customers using multiple services.

The obsession with growth leads to two forms of expansion: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal expansion involves moving into adjacent markets, as exemplified by Apple and Amazon, while vertical expansion involves bringing supply chain activities in-house, as seen in Google's advertising business, which has vertically integrated the different processes involved in online advertising.

Large tech companies like Google, Apple, and Tesla are engaging in vertical integration by acquiring companies and making their own hardware, including specialized chips for AI operations. These companies also invest heavily in research and development to create new sectors of the economy that they can dominate. For example, Alphabet is researching cold fusion, which is far from their core business of search engine advertising.

Alphabet's R&D efforts extend beyond their core business, including funding experiments in multiple sectors and creating new businesses like Malta, which stores energy cleanly. As dominant market positions become increasingly common in the Exponential Age, the traditional approach to antitrust law may not be sufficient to address issues posed by these firms. The standard approach, which focuses on consumer welfare, was developed in the 1970s by Robert Bork and may require a rethink.

The exponential improvement in technology and internet products provides consumers with cheaper and more efficient experiences, despite the presence of monopolies like Google and Amazon. However, traditional frameworks for understanding monopoly, such as Robert Bork's, may not account for issues created by monopolistic companies in the exponential age. One issue is that modern monopolies could exploit smaller-scale producers, such as Apple's App Store charging software developers fees to sell their products. The fairness of these fees is questionable, but the problem is not easily addressed by existing norms and rules.

Apple's creation of the App Store created a mobile app market and provided a secure, trusted, and easy buying process, but the fairness of its fees for developers, which are 30% for larger ones, is questionable. Developers like Epic Games have challenged Apple's fees, but it is difficult to determine a fair price in the absence of a competitive market where Apple has an 80% market share among young people. Similar oligopolistic practices hurting sellers are common across platforms, such as Google's vertical integration of its ad business, which has been accused of questionable business practices.

Google has been fined $1.8 billion for abusing its dominant position in the ads market and there are concerns about its vertical integration in the advertising market. The dominance of large companies can lead to a loss of dynamism across an economy, but there are signs of agility in the Exponential Age with many new start-ups being created and well-funded. Venture capitalists continue to invest in new companies globally, suggesting a dynamic and vibrant economy. Small businesses are the ones who suffer due to lack of effective competition.

Large firms are adept at cementing their position in the market by acquiring nascent competitors, which has long-term consequences for innovation. Breakthrough inventions are more likely to come from individual inventors or smaller teams. Research conducted by corporate giants tends to be narrow compared to academic research, reducing the number of pathways explored. Tech companies have even diverted scientists' attention away from big-picture scientific research by poaching university professors. Between 2004 and 2018, 221 AI professors left academia to pursue a career in the computer industry or start their own.

The article discusses the challenges of monopolies in the Exponential Age and the impact on research, as well as the issue of tax avoidance by large tech companies. The article highlights that the brain drain from universities to the private sector poses a risk to research becoming more narrow and focused on commercial priorities. Moreover, it emphasizes that large tech companies pay little tax due to the intangible nature of their assets and the loopholes they use to avoid paying taxes.

The article suggests that countries need to adopt a new way of thinking about monopoly in the Exponential Age, and that a change of mindset is necessary. It highlights that the dominance of big tech companies has given rise to new antitrust ideas, such as focusing on conflicts of interest rather than consumer impact. The article also notes the importance of developing a new set of rules to prevent large companies from wielding too much power.

Antitrust bodies should block big companies from acquiring smaller ones more confidently, and regulators should reserve the right to approve acquisitions by large companies and sell them off if they become troublesome. Interoperability between platforms could also be implemented to reduce network effects that enable companies to grow larger.

Interoperability can reduce the network effect and prevent a single company from becoming a monopoly, as seen in the example of mobile phone companies in the early 1990s. Steps are being taken to make interoperability a reality across sectors, such as in the financial industry with open banking.

The European Commission's Digital Markets Act proposes new obligations for dominant network platforms, including interoperability between platforms. Treating digital firms as utilities with stringent demands and higher standards could limit their power. Digital firms have become an essential part of daily life and participation in society, which comes with responsibility. Essential facilities must share their infrastructure with competitors in a fair way, as seen with BT's phone network.

Openreach, a separate company from BT, invests in and sells services to BT and other phone companies with equal access to the network. The proposed Digital Services Act in the EU imposes new obligations on platforms that reach more than 10% of Europeans, including greater reporting, auditing, and data sharing requirements. Policies aim to close the exponential gap and address winner-takes-all markets. Institutional change has been slow to address the issues of platform dominance and increasing returns to scale observed in the tech industry since 1996.

Governments have attempted to regulate the world's largest industry using outdated industrial-age thinking, but policies that bridge the exponential age gap are within reach through collaboration between academia, jurisprudence, think tanks, and business forums. Automation in the workplace has caused fear and tension between employers and workers since the industrial revolution, but the era for which rules were made has ended, and new rules must be created. This fear is not new, and movements such as the Luddites have risen in response to machines taking jobs.

Anxieties about technological unemployment are not new and tend to arise during periods of rapid technological change. The rise of robots and artificial intelligence (AI) is encroaching on human work, and these systems are rapidly becoming more advanced, performing tasks that were once thought of as quintessentially human. Automation raises the prospect of mass redundancy and renders workers unemployed and unemployable, raising an existential threat.

Geoffrey Hinton, an AI pioneer, predicted in 2016 that deep learning would surpass radiologists within five years, but he was both right and wrong. AI systems in machine vision have improved, but the number of radiologists has increased instead of decreasing. Radiologists remain in high demand and short supply.

Automated systems are helping overworked radiologists rather than replacing them, and the idea of a jobless future is overstated. Historically, automation has created more work than it destroys, as it invents new sectors of the economy and creates jobs that require new and distinctly human skills. The rise of the robots narrative is a distraction from the fact that we are living through a major transition in the history of work, which has the potential to cause workplace exploitation if not handled properly. The quantity of jobs is likely to remain high, but the quality of jobs may be affected.

The emergence of new technologies is creating an exponential gap between working arrangements and outdated norms. Platform business models are creating new ways for companies to organize work, leading to an emphasis on gig-working. Employers are implementing automated management systems to boost efficiency and productivity, often at the expense of worker's well-being. The share of value going to the workforce is declining, leading to a wedge between those who can harness the power of the Exponential Age and those who will be left behind. The notion of mass automation and job losses is not as simple as the robopocalypse, but rather a combination of three forces. AI breakthroughs in perception, communication, planning, and manipulation are making large chunks of the workforce redundant.

Research predicted that up to 47% of US jobs were at risk of redundancy due to automation. This narrative proved true in the 2010s, with many people losing their jobs to automation, especially in the banking industry. Companies launched initiatives to eliminate white-collar labor, leading to a boom in office automation. A Romanian firm called UiPath saw significant growth due to large firms turning to it to automate white-collar work. As automation gathers pace, the argument that its effects would show up in employment statistics seemed indisputable.

The manufacturing sector in the US has been producing more with fewer employees over the years. This trend has continued with tech companies, where the biggest firms have fewer employees but generate more revenue. However, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, employment figures were at record highs in many countries, including OECD nations.

Despite the fear of automation threatening the workforce, unemployment was at its lowest since 2009. Automation is still at an early stage, and many jobs are harder to automate than anticipated. Moravec's paradox highlights that while computers can exhibit adult-level performance in some areas, they struggle with more human skills. Sectors like Wall Street trading require skills that are difficult to automate, while sectors like food service and cleaning require more manual dexterity.

Trading on financial exchanges, including fund management, is increasingly being automated, with algorithms replacing humans. The use of automated trading has increased from 30% of all shares traded in 2006 to nearly 70% a decade later. Even fund managers are being replaced by automated systems, with over half of all global assets under management going to simple rules-based funds in late 2019. Computer programs are shown to be more effective than humans in managing portfolios. However, automation in other jobs is more complicated than trading on Wall Street.

Many jobs involve tasks that are not written down and are learned through experience and human interaction. The tacit knowledge gained through co-worker interactions and workplace environments is not easily codified. Low-skill jobs, often considered repetitive and easily automatable, often involve emotional labor and human interaction that may be difficult to automate. These types of jobs may have more in common with care work than manual labor.

The knowledge and skills required to successfully perform a job often involve tacit knowledge that is difficult to teach to an AI system. This makes automation a slow and gradual process that requires simplification of tasks. While AI systems have made progress, they are still only capable of handling relatively simple and structured tasks, and full automation is still some way off.

Automation is a tool that companies can use to become more competitive, rather than causing mass unemployment. The Covid-19 pandemic showed that digital giants like Amazon, which is an aggressively automated company, benefited from the shift to online shopping. Automation allows companies to create automated connections and better coordination, making them more efficient and competitive.

Amazon has become a leader in automation and robotics with an astonishing one physical robot for every four workers, yet it has also been on a hiring spree with 308,000 new jobs globally in one year after the COVID-19 outbreak. Other firms like Netflix that invested in automation and AI also continued to hire throughout the pandemic, indicating that automation can create more jobs than it destroys at the company level.

The more companies like Amazon and Netflix automate, the more they grow and employ people. Automation, growth, and increasing employee numbers go hand in hand. Where workers lose their jobs due to automation, it's often because the firms they work for fail to invest in the training that their employees need to implement the latest technologies, not because they are replaced by software.

The ability of firms to adapt to changing circumstances is crucial for their survival in the age of automation. Companies that fail to adapt, like Blockbuster, are at risk of being replaced by competitors with more digitally enabled business models. However, a recent survey found that firms adopting robots became more profitable, productive and created jobs, while their competitors experienced a decline in employment. The key threat from automation is therefore traditional competition rather than the automation itself.

Individual companies benefit from automation, but at the macroeconomic level, automation may still lead to job losses. Studies have found that automation in the manufacturing sector displaced jobs and reduced wages, but other studies suggest that automation can increase overall employment. The World Economic Forum predicts that automation will create more jobs than it destroys. The estimates for net job loss from automation have been disappearing to the point of being negligible over time. This goes against the belief that there is only so much work to go around.

The belief that increasing female labour participation, immigration, or robots will reduce available work is a form of zero-sum thinking known as the "lump of labour fallacy," which has been largely dispensed with by economic theory and historical evidence. The development of new technologies creates new needs, which create new sectors of the economy and require suitably skilled workers. The author gives an example of Sid Karunaratne, who was hired to tend to the cluster of servers that ran their data analytics and prediction start-up, which was a full-time job due to bugs, inconsistencies, and data volumes that caused servers to crash. Sid was also responsible for making updates and addressing security vulnerabilities.

As a data analytics and prediction start-up grew, the computing demands increased exponentially and the master data repository grew from a few million records to tens of billions. The server-sitter, Sid, mastered new skills and automated his own job, which created more opportunities for him and the team to turn to more complex and important tasks, generating more opportunities and work. This process is seen with many technologies, as companies that invest in artificial intelligence create new types of jobs, not just within their own company but across the economy.

Automation leads to more jobs in the long run, but in the short term, it may cause job losses. Technologies have historically created more jobs than they have destroyed. The impact of automation will not be the loss of jobs but the quality of available work options. Uber provides a demonstration of how work is obtained differently in the Exponential Age, with millions of drivers as gig workers rather than employees.

Uber's success in using gig workers rather than contracted employees raises questions about employment in the Exponential Age. The concept of the gig economy originated with Amazon Mechanical Turk in 2005, where short-term, freelance tasks are allocated online. The service gets its name from a chess-playing device from the late 18th century, and it relies on hidden human labor to complete small and well-defined tasks just beyond the reach of current AI systems.

Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform, allowed companies to outsource mind-numbing data classification tasks to workers called Turkers, who could earn small fees for completing them. This led to the emergence of crowdsourcing, a concept where the internet connects people needing work done with those who have the time and skill to do it. Crowdsourcing platforms multiplied, with services ranging from programming to less complex tasks. The advent of smartphones with GPS enabled local and convenient services, such as ordering taxis, takeaway food, and massages.

Crowdsourcing gave way to the gig economy, which is underpinned by the emerging exponential economy and general-purpose technologies like the internet and the smartphone. Gig economy platforms have continued to grow exponentially, disrupting once-stable markets and resulting in more gig workers. These platforms could add millions of full-time positions to the global labor market. Evangelists for the gig economy claim it helps workers by making work more flexible and enabling them to earn money on the side.

Gig-working platforms can create more efficient labor markets and improve the quality of work. They make it easier to connect buyers and sellers, leading to an increase in opportunities for workers. Platforms like Uber and Kobo360 help make markets more efficient by making it easier to discover and apply for jobs globally. In part-time roles, platforms like UpWork help workers access the global economy. The flexibility of gig work is a benefit for workers in developed economies.

Gig work is generally more flexible and less formal in richer countries, while in poorer ones, it can offer more security, more employment options, and greater freedoms than casual labor. Gig workers prioritize pay and flexible schedules. However, pay is often poor compared to traditional work, and working patterns can be precarious. The platforms themselves can make unilateral changes and maintain internal scores about workers, which might affect what jobs they are offered. Unions or other collective arrangements are uncommon among independent workers on gig platforms, which means there is often no collective voice to represent them.

Gig workers in the UK and EU often earn less than minimum wage, and their take-home pay can be further reduced by expenses. Precarious working conditions are common in the gig economy as the workers are often considered self-employed, which means they miss out on employment benefits and labor rights. Gig companies act as intermediaries and claim not to employ the workers.

Gig companies, particularly in ride-hailing and food delivery sectors, have been reluctant to provide protections to their workforce, who are often classified as independent contractors. However, some legal battles have been fought to have gig workers classified as employees, which would grant them more protections and benefits. In California, a proposition was passed to allow companies like Uber and Lyft to continue classifying drivers as independent contractors with some wage and health protections. In the UK, a court ruled that Uber drivers should be considered workers and not self-employed entrepreneurs as Uber controls many aspects of their work.

Exponential technologies have enabled new modes of employment, creating a gap with labour laws designed in the twentieth century. This leads to a growing inequality between gig workers and official employees, and the gap is far from closing. The self-employed face the whims of their clients, and only a small group will retain the privileges that workers have fought to gain over the last 150 years. Bundy's time recorder became one of the defining inventions of the twentieth-century workplace and represented an early move towards a more scientific, regulated, empirical system of people management.

Methods of managing employees became more sophisticated, including the rise of scientific management pioneered by Frederick Winslow Taylor. Taylorism underpinned much of the productivity growth of twentieth-century businesses but was also punitive, leading to constant surveillance of workers and treating them like machines. The unobserved worker is considered an inefficient worker under Taylorism, and as time went on, it became more intrusive in the lives of workers. Lillian Gilbreth developed personality and psychological testing for personnel management staff, which became the norm in large organizations, leading to workplace surveillance designed to make workers internalize their boss's gaze.

Technology companies have shifted from a punitive workplace culture towards a more employee-friendly environment, offering amenities such as free food, unlimited time off, and fertility treatments. The trend began in the run-up to the dot-com boom and has become the norm in the 21st century, with bigger companies offering more generous perks. Netflix offers unlimited vacation time while Google provides unusually generous death benefits. This shift has been ongoing, and even before the pandemic, many companies were already used to providing these benefits.

The tools of digital work have allowed for remote work and flexible working hours, which only accelerated during the pandemic. However, not every employee has the freedom to work how and where they like, and workplace devices can be turned against them, creating an inescapable digital panopticon where every message and document update is logged. Surveillance methods like facial recognition and mood detection systems are increasingly common, which can create a feeling of being constantly watched and monitored.

Employers are increasingly using technology to monitor and track their employees, including scanning emails, measuring movements, and tracking facial expressions. The use of these technologies is becoming more invasive, with some companies using brainwave-reading hats to track workers' emotions. Automated monitoring systems are also being used in the recruitment process, and some large corporations are monitoring the content of employee emails and social media accounts. The move to remote work during Covid-19 has accelerated this trend, and many employees believe that monitoring is currently taking place in their workplace. This raises concerns about surveillance and automated management, particularly for gig workers on platform apps who have limited control over how they work.

Gig economy giants, especially ride-hailing companies, use algorithmic management to scrutinize workers through quantitative performance assessments. Warehouse workers and drivers are managed by scanners and algorithms, which can lead to dehumanization, low pay, and job instability. This system of management resembles Taylorism on steroids and heavily favors bosses, leaving workers with little bargaining power. Amazon automatically fires about 10% of its factory staff annually for not meeting productivity metrics. Workers are questioning this dehumanizing form of management and their lack of collective bargaining power.

The increasing use of algorithms in the workplace can lead to high-quality work for some and low-quality, insecure work for others, with a growing divide between them. The decline in the share of national income going to workers, as opposed to owners of capital, is also a concern. While work still exists, it may no longer serve the interests of society.

Workers have been receiving a smaller share of the economic pie for decades, with declining wages and increasing inequality. This is due to factors such as globalization, the decline of unions, the rise of the intangible economy, and superstarification. While economic productivity continues to rise, workers' pay has stagnated, with the decline in labour's share of the economic pie being closely related to the shift to the exponential economy.

The rise of exponential technologies and intangible economy dominated by big firms has led to wage pressure and job loss for workers. However, some jobs created by these technologies, such as engineering jobs at Uber, offer high salaries. On the other hand, gig workers like Uber drivers are often paid relatively little. There is a similar wage dynamic at work in companies like Facebook, where content moderators are paid much less than other employees. Ordinary people who create content on these platforms are not paid at all.

The Exponential Age economy is characterized by a bifurcation of workers, with highly educated knowledge-workers compensated well and less skilled workers often poorly rewarded. This has led to a reduced share of income going to employees and the disappearance of middle-wage earners. While new technology has historically led to improvements in working life, there are winners and losers in global labor markets. The gains of technology have not always translated to wage increases for ordinary workers, and it can take time for wages to catch up.

The widening gap between new technology and workplace norms and laws has created pernicious chasms in the labor market. However, new ideas are emerging on how to adapt to the Exponential Age. To create a fairer work settlement, workers need dignity, which can be achieved through voluntary and worker-centered use of new technologies. New management approaches are needed to prevent bosses from taking advantage of power differentials and give employees greater autonomy.

To create a fairer work settlement, workers should have a chance to seek redress when algorithms are unfair, access to data held about them, and clearer explanations on how automated decisions are made. Unions can help workers win back data rights. Given the volatility of work in the Exponential Age, reskilling is crucial for workers to adapt to constant change and new industries. Digital technology, such as educational apps like TikTok, can help provide opportunities for continuous learning.

TikTok is exploring digital learning with educational content produced by experts and institutions. A safety net is critical for workers in times of rapid change, with some advocating for universal basic income (UBI) as a solution. Small-scale experiments show UBI recipients report increased wellbeing and are more likely to get back into work within a year. However, concerns about weakening work ethic and creating dependency continue to plague UBI. Denmark has a cheaper and more politically palatable alternative in place.

The Danish flexicurity model provides employers with hiring and firing flexibility while offering extensive protections and benefits to employees who become unemployed. Workers need equity in the face of new technologies that shift power towards capital. Employers must invest more in worker development to bridge the gap between low- and high-skilled workers, and minimum-wage bargaining becomes more important than ever.

To mitigate the growing wage differentials, policymakers should ensure the minimum wage reflects the cost of living and encourage greater wage transparency to illuminate income disparities. While some organizations are already working to close wage gaps, entrepreneurship alone is not enough and meaningful improvements for workers require pressure by employees. Portify, a start-up in London, helps freelance workers build their credit ratings month by month. However, history shows that improvements for workers have come from labor organizing and pressure from employees.

New unionism appealed to the urban working class and resulted in the emergence of social democratic parties. However, trade unions have fallen out of fashion in the Anglosphere following a 50-year assault by the political establishment, resulting in the lowest union membership since records began. The tech industry has been anti-union since its inception, and the workforces of digital superstars remain un-unionized. Margaret Thatcher's government perceived trade unions as a threat, while in the US, Ronald Reagan fired over 11,000 striking air-traffic controllers, marking a turning point in American trade unionism.

Despite obstacles faced by workers at tech companies trying to organize, collective action remains the best way to guarantee fair workplaces. Unions are necessary for collective bargaining and developing the expertise to navigate a rapidly changing economy. Digital technology both poses a problem and offers a solution in unionization efforts. The use of technology for collectivization is becoming more uniform, as workers are increasingly turning to informal collectivization on WhatsApp groups and online forums to find like-minded people to collaborate with. The process of unionization often begins with these informal groups and unions are necessary to build a dignified, flexible, secure, and equitable employment settlement.

Digitally enabled unions can adapt to the changing economy and ensure employment laws follow suit. Collective bargaining and worker organization are crucial for ensuring employers remain conscious of workers' needs and for addressing power imbalances between bosses and workers. Workers face a fundamental shift in the quality of working arrangements due to gig-working and algorithmic management, but this power imbalance is not inevitable. The International Alliance of App-Based Transport Workers is an example of digitally enabled unions that can organize for better working conditions globally.

Pix Moving, a start-up, uses additive manufacturing techniques to print components locally and assembles them near the customer's location, rather than exporting cars. This approach helps the company to skirt around customs inspectors and tariffs, and represents an inversion of globalisation, as it allows for manufacturing to happen near the consumer. The use of 3D printing enables the production of components locally, while the design can come from anywhere. This reflects how manufacturing is changing as we move further into the Exponential Age and unpicks our assumptions about globalisation.

The text discusses the history and benefits of globalisation, tracing it back to the activities of transnational corporations in the nineteenth century, followed by the monolithic industrial firms of the post-war era. Thomas Friedman's book, "The World is Flat", identifies ten "flatteners" that would make the world more globalised in his third phase of globalisation. Globalisation was supported by international institutions, multilateral institutions, and the private sector, leading to an increase in trade and wealth around the world. The benefits of globalisation include better standards of living and the reduction of poverty.

Globalization lost its appeal after the financial crisis of 2007-2009 due to growing income inequality, concerns about immigration, and deindustrialization. Exponential technologies create the rationale for more borders and provide the tools to build them. Breakthrough technologies favor the local and lead to a return to the local, as they facilitate the local production of energy and food in a cost-effective manner.

Exponential technologies favor local production and lead to a return to the local. Economic activity is set to become increasingly local due to the fragility of global supply chains and potential future events such as war and extreme weather. Our political and economic systems were not designed to cope with the new age of localism, and gaps emerge between economic policies and the actual workings of the de-globalized economy. The world is becoming spiky, and the classic rationale for globalization based on freer trade is challenged. Specialization and comparative advantage are generally more productive than self-sufficiency.

Countries should focus on producing and exporting what they are good at, taking advantage of different economic opportunities. Global trade has created complex supply chains, allowing for goods to be produced and transported all over the world. Thanks to global trade, people can access a wide range of products that may not be available locally due to climatic conditions. Orders are processed and delivered within a few days, thanks to national distribution hubs and logistics companies.

The trend towards global trade in physical products is being reversed by new technologies that enable local production of food. Urban vertical farms, which use AI systems to control lighting, water, and heat, are highly efficient and require less water and no pesticides or chemicals. By using renewable energy, they have a lower carbon footprint. These farms can be built anywhere, reducing the need for food transportation.

Urban farms, such as Montreal's Lufa Farms greenhouse, are built closer to retailers for fresher and more nutritious products. High-intensity vertical farms are growing rapidly, reducing dependence on global logistics for food. Renewables are putting every nation on a path to energy independence, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and the need for world trade in prehistoric energy.

The shift towards renewable energy drastically reduces the need for transportation of fossil fuels and reduces global dependence on fossil-rich nations. Renewables are becoming more equitably distributed and innovations in energy storage systems bring electricity closer to home, such as through electric vehicles that can also power homes and offices. The amount of electricity used in the economy has declined while GDP has increased, and this trend is seen in many countries.

In the future, electric cars with vehicle-to-grid systems could lend their stored energy to homes during periods of darkness, potentially covering a whole country's needs. Simon Daniel's company Moixa is stringing together thousands of idle electric car batteries to form a virtual power plant, managing them with sophisticated algorithms to balance usage. He has combined 20,000 batteries in several Japanese cities, enough to power 25,000 homes for a day. Biotech start-up Zymergen is using machine learning and genetics to efficiently produce industrial materials from microbes, potentially reducing reliance on crude oil derivatives.

Hyaline, a product by biotech start-up Zymergen, uses natural processes to grow smartphone screen film, reducing dependence on fossil fuels in the production of prosthetic materials. While we may become more dependent on new commodities like lithium and rare earth metals, the wider trend is towards an economy based on less stuff, with decreasing dependence on some commodities altogether. Manufacturing in the Exponential Age is becoming increasingly localised, with building processes taking place close to the point of consumption, potentially making the global network of factories, supply chains, and offices redundant. This is driven by the surging importance of intangible assets in the exponential economy.

Intangibles such as design, orchestration, and brand make up three-fifths of the value of products like the iPhone. The rise of new technologies like AI and advanced manufacturing methods are shifting the value towards intangibles. Advanced manufacturing requires fewer workers, making it economically feasible to produce in places with high labor costs. Adidas' Speedfactory in Germany produced shoes using robots, automation, and 3D printing, but was eventually wound down due to the limitations of the technology. While end-to-end additive manufacturing is relatively expensive, it is an exponential technology that is likely to become more affordable in the future.

3D printing is expensive due to low-volume production but will become cheaper as the technology improves and drives down costs. During the Covid-19 pandemic, schools and universities used 3D printers to produce masks and visors for hospitals. The global market for 3D printing is small but growing and finding uses among demanding customers such as those making components for cars and planes. 3D printed parts use less material and can save costs. BMW uses 3D printing for parts in their i8 electric sports car, and the company plans to produce tens of thousands of components using this approach. This could lead to a new system of global trade, with less dependence on poor countries manufacturing goods for rich countries.

The re-localisation of production in rich countries due to new technology may destabilize the economies of developing countries, as they heavily depend on exporting raw materials. Their economies rise and fall with commodity prices and a decrease in demand for imported raw materials may lead to a precipitous position for such countries.

The decreasing reliance on commodities and shift towards localized manufacturing could lead to political instability and wipe out decades of growth in trade. 3D printing could eliminate up to 40% of world imports by 2040, transforming the global supply chain and negatively impacting struggling parts of the developing world that rely on global demand for cheap labor. The trends of localized manufacturing and local production of food and energy could have significant consequences.

The cost of maintaining global security and stability has eroded the authority of states and multilateral institutions. The US has achieved energy sufficiency through investments in fracking, making it less willing to intervene in petrostates. Exponential technology will further transform global institutions, and disengagement from economic development in poor countries may hinder progress. More than 50% of the world's population resides in metropolitan areas, marking a new era, with cities growing in scale throughout history.

Cities have been historically important engines of wealth creation, trade, and culture, but have been neglected in political terms and metrics that prioritize countries. In the Exponential Age, cities will become more important due to the rise of the intangible economy and the clustering of highly skilled knowledge workers around physical institutions such as universities. Complex technologies require many specialists working together, and cities provide the necessary infrastructure and talent for innovation.

Cities in the Exponential Age attract talented people from across sectors in a process known as agglomeration, leading to specialized intangible-powered cities like Mumbai, Tel Aviv, and Hsinchu. The accumulation of talent in urban areas helps existing businesses and industries and leads to the emergence of new ideas through innovation and serendipity. Proximity to strangers allows for the encounter of millions of different variables, leading to a greater chance of finding something useful.

Cities are full of strangers, which leads to the mingling of ideas and perpetual growth. As cities become better at their specialties, they attract even more talented individuals, creating a positive feedback loop of growth and innovation. This will lead to the continued growth of megacities, particularly in developing countries. The Greater Bay Area, a megalopolis in China, is an example of this trend.

The benefits of urbanization, particularly in high-tech and emerging sectors, are evident in Africa's rapidly growing cities such as Lagos, Dar es Salaam, and Khartoum. While the Covid-19 pandemic led to a temporary exodus from cities, they bounced back quickly. As cities grow in size and wealth, an earnings gap between urban and rural populations creates a potential conflict between national and city-level governments. This tension is exemplified in London's suspension of Uber's license and the prime minister's lack of support for the decision.

The tension between liberal, high-tech cities and less liberal national governments is exemplified in clashes over issues like immigration. The Exponential Age favors diverse urban populations and leads to conflicts over where decisions about daily life should be made. John Perry Barlow's 1996 Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace highlights the shift of significance from nation-states to cities in the digital age.



 The internet transcends national boundaries and represents globalisation. 

 It undermines the notion of territorial sovereignty and provides a space for free expression of ideas. 

 The elimination of government-controlled media allows for protestors to communicate freely. 

 The internet helps build a uniquely international culture online, but still has distinct national markers with American norms.



 The key protocols, standard procedures, and institutions of internet governance were mostly created by Americans with liberal and sceptical views of centralised authority. 

 The ideal of a global, borderless internet is now fragmented into regional and national spheres, with governments finding new ways to bring the internet under their control. 

 Authoritarian regimes restrict internet use, while liberal democracies impose data protection laws that limit the spread of data. 

 Some governments view data as a national asset to be controlled and restrict the transfer of data out of the country.

The trend of physically building data farms in countries is growing, leading to the internet becoming increasingly localized. Data protection laws are complicated and inconsistent, and the number of countries introducing territorial rules around data has almost tripled in the decade leading up to 2016. This poses a problem for policymakers as institutions built during an era of assumed locality may not be suitable for a world of national self-sufficiency and growing technological divisions. Responses are needed to address the growing gaps between high-tech, rich nations and their poorer counterparts, as well as between liberal cities and conservative national polities.

International cooperation remains important for global challenges, but a new approach is needed as the basis for cooperation shifts from trade. One solution is to establish institutions like a World Data Organization to coordinate a consistent approach towards emerging global issues, such as artificial intelligence and intellectual property. Digital minilateralism can also help prevent re-localized economies resulting in new barriers between nations by promoting small group cooperation on digital regulation. The goal is to keep data flowing between borders to prevent economies from falling into siloes.

The article discusses two growing divides - between rich and poor countries and between nation states and cities - and suggests that minilateral organizations may be more effective in addressing these issues than universal organizations like the UN. It also suggests developing federal models of national politics that give more power to regions and cities to manage their own affairs, which may help close the rural-urban divide. Cities are seen as important players in the Exponential Age economy and need more recognition and autonomy to tackle problems caused by exponential technology.

Cities are taking a more active role in identifying shared policies and working together through initiatives like C40 and Mayors for a Guaranteed Income. However, the current institutional arrangements are ill-equipped to deal with the terrain created by exponential technologies. As tensions mount between urban and rural areas, it is possible that wars between and within countries will become more common, and our approach to warfare is being disrupted as dramatically as our approach to geography. The risk of this process leading us into an era of political and economic disorder needs to be mitigated.

In 2007, Estonia's decision to relocate a Soviet-era statue triggered riots and one of the most successful cyberattacks in history. The attack targeted the national infrastructure, including media, banking, and government services, and was accompanied by a coordinated wave of misinformation. The Estonian government, which was one of the most digitally connected countries in the world, was forced to disconnect the country from the global internet to end the attack. The attackers' identity is still unclear, but many officials blamed the Kremlin due to the attack originating from Russian IP addresses and online instructions in Russian.

The 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, blamed on the Kremlin, changed the world by demonstrating the power of cyberattacks and presaging the future of conflict. Exponential technologies have made the cost of building certain types of weapons and launching more nebulous forms of attack much cheaper. The cost of warfare in the physical world is also diminishing, and none of these cheaper forms of attack puts the attacker in the immediate line of fire. As a member of NATO, Estonia considered invoking Article 5 but lacked absolute proof that the cyberattacks were from the Russian state, and it was not clear whether Article 5 would cover cyberattacks.

As more digital devices are owned, vulnerabilities increase and people become more vulnerable to cyberattacks. This is known as the attack surface, and it has expanded due to the rise of new military technologies. This creates an exponential gap that creates opportunities for adversaries, making security systems look feeble.

As methods and sites of cyberattacks increase, national security infrastructure struggles to adapt, creating an exponential gap. Digital warfare requires the establishment of rules and protocols, and there is uncertainty surrounding the response to cyberattacks. Growing political instability and localised production may lead to more conflict, despite the historically held idea that global trade promotes peace.

Increased bilateral trade interdependence and global trade openness significantly reduce the probability of military conflict between countries, so a turn against globalisation may lead to greater conflict. Conflicts within nations are becoming more common, led by non-state actors driven by religious and cultural identities. The number of non-state conflicts has more than doubled in the past decade, and while exponential technologies have not caused this shift, Exponential Age trends have contributed.

The next few decades could see constant conflict as non-state actors become increasingly involved in war, while nations' ability to defend themselves becomes flimsy due to technology. Military technology has changed how war is fought, making old strategies obsolete. The risk of nuclear escalation was a concern in past military operations, such as Israel's Operation Opera in 1981, which was expensive and risky.

In the past, Israel destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor with explosives, but now they are concerned about Iran's nuclear ambitions. Instead of using physical attacks, they launched a cyber attack called Stuxnet on Iran's Natanz nuclear site, which damaged their nuclear capabilities. Stuxnet was designed to target the software running on electronics made by Siemens. This attack showed the vulnerability of all states with digital interfaces and increased the number of attack surfaces within governments.

Millions of civilian-targeted cyberattacks occur daily and 96% of British businesses suffered a damaging cyberattack in 2019. Data leaks are common consequences of cyberattacks, with over 37 billion data records leaked globally in 2020. Many people lack the ability to protect themselves from cyberattacks, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse, including attacks on unsuspecting electric cars and GPS spoofing. Some attacks have catastrophic consequences, such as the Russian operation that debilitated Ukraine's banking system in 2017.

The spread of malware, such as NotPetya, across countries through the internet has caused billions of dollars in damages, affecting global companies. The proliferation of digital attack targets and methods is changing the nature of contemporary warfare, allowing unexpected actors like North Korea's cyber army to participate in illegal state activities and fuel its GDP through cyber warfare and organized crime. North Korean cyber experts have raised up to $2 billion for the country's weapons programs through illegal means, making cyber warfare a cheaper form of extraterritorial activity.

The use of cyber warfare by nations, such as North Korea and Iran, allows them to have a disproportionate impact on foreign policy, even if they have lower military spending than their rivals. Cyber attacks can cause significant damage and disruption to critical infrastructure, and many countries are not prepared to defend against them. Traditional conceptions of warfare and defense do not effectively address the challenges of cyber warfare, as it is difficult to regulate and attribute responsibility for attacks carried out by thousands of actors in a digital realm without official acknowledgement.

Sandworm, allegedly part of Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate, was responsible for the NotPetya cyberattack, as well as Russia's election meddling, downing of a Malaysian plane, and a failed assassination attempt in the UK. Sandworm's goal is sometimes chaos, and it exploited holes in the Microsoft operating system to create disorder in Ukraine. The inadequacy of existing forms of national defense was revealed when Maersk, one of Denmark's leading businesses, was crippled by Sandworm's cyberattack, and the Danish state could do little to help. Most nations' cyber defenses remain feeble, and private security researchers and companies have had to step in to stop cyberattacks.

Nations are struggling to defend against cyberattacks, and offensive capabilities have only recently been adopted. The SolarWinds attack on the US government departments revealed the limited effectiveness of defensive capabilities. Outlaws, acting alone or at the behest of a state, appear powerful. Veles, a city in North Macedonia, became known for its fake news factories in the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election, where local teens wrote and published right-wing news stories on social media that were widely shared and profitable.

The exponential age has made it easier to produce viral misinformation that can influence national politics. In the past, misinformation required skilled hackers or complex codes, but now it just needs the global public to believe it. Members of Veles made upwards of $2,000 per day from online advertising by reporting on US politics, even though they had little understanding of the subject. The use of misinformation to motivate an army or dispirit the opposition is an old tactic, but the Exponential Age has made it easier to produce. In 2014, viral misinformation was a small but tangible problem, but it has grown rapidly since then.

The number of false claims on Twitter in English-language tweets increased by a factor of 30 from 2012 to 2016, and falsehoods spread six times faster than the truth. Exponential technologies make the spread of misinformation much more likely, with social networks providing fertile ground for content without fact-checking or editorial oversight. Nearly 9 out of 10 people exposed to fake news initially believed it was real, with nearly half of Turks and over 30% of Koreans, Brazilians, and Mexicans exposed to fake news on a weekly basis. Some fake news is created for profit, while nation-states use it as a form of gaining an advantage over an adversary.

Misinformation used as a military tactic is becoming increasingly common, with evidence that 70 countries have undertaken online disinformation operations, with Russia responsible for the majority. China has also been accused of using misinformation campaigns, as have other countries. When used by states, misinformation becomes disinformation, actively malicious rather than merely inaccurate, and can have real-world impacts, such as the deaths of 700 people in Iran who drank methanol following online rumors. Misinformation campaigns have been used to weaken responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, and in the UK, telecoms engineers have received death threats due to conspiracy theories about 5G spreading the virus.

Exponential technologies and governments' inability to counter misinformation have contributed to the rise of disinformation campaigns, which aim to delegitimise efforts to control the spread of Covid-19 and the vaccination programme. The lack of coordinated counter-disinformation strategies by governments has been criticised. While disinformation can sow doubt, cyberattacks can weaken economies, physical battlefield technologies such as drones can be used to attack adversaries. The declining prices of weaponry have catalysed conflicts, resulting in a multifaceted form of warfare fought simultaneously in private forums, public life, and streets.

Drones initially played a limited role in military exercises but were increasingly used by the US military, especially during the War on Terror. President Obama authorized 542 drone attacks, killing 3,797 people, including civilians. Consumer drone technology developed rapidly, thanks to advances in microchips, batteries, robotics, and AI. The development of accelerometers, which test for changes in an object's speed, was due to smartphone technology. As a result, the price of drone technology decreased, making it accessible for public events.

Advances in drone technology have led to the development of ever more sophisticated and expensive military drones, as well as cheaper drones accessible to smaller states and terrorist groups. This has driven an increase in asymmetric conflict and exacerbated conflicts between nation states. The development of drones has made battlefield warfare affordable to a wider range of actors, and conflicts such as the Nagorno-Karabakh region have become showcases of the latest drone technology.

Azerbaijan's use of advanced drones, with the help of Turkey and Israel, in its conflict with Armenia was a turning point in realizing the vulnerability of traditional men-and-materiel approach to warfare. The agility and precision of drones make them more effective in accessing hard-to-reach areas, improving accuracy, and potentially confusing enemy radars. However, they also make illegal forms of warfare, such as chemical warfare, more likely, and could be tempting for rogue nations. The UK's Ministry of Defence has already turned its attention to buying cheaper armed drones.

The exponential transformation of drones is still ongoing and the development of fully autonomous drones is possible. The Israeli-developed drones Harpy and Harop are already in use as autonomous weapons. The development of facial recognition and computer vision will further enhance the power of such technology on the battlefield. Autonomous systems could support warfare by undertaking complex and coordinated actions faster and more efficiently than humans, and communication delays could be eliminated. Over a third of weapons systems with automated-targeting capabilities could select targets and attack without human intervention.

The development of fully autonomous weapons systems using sensor-equipped drones with on-board computers poses a risk to the current norms and regulations surrounding war, as it challenges the assumption that humans are in absolute control. The responsibility gap arising from the lack of clarity surrounding how courts might deal with crimes arising from the use of autonomous or semi-autonomous weapons is a concern. War in the exponential world is cheap, making it easier for more actors to strike larger attack surfaces, and the results can range from nuisance-level misinformation to meticulously planned attacks.

The combination of political instability and new technology could lead to never-ending conflict, with cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns as part of the same ecosystem. States need to strengthen their defenses, establish new norms surrounding communication and escalation, and work to reduce the proliferation of attack surfaces and weapons to resolve the escalating conflicts of the Exponential Age. The first duty of the state is to protect its citizens from violence, and if they can't prevent citizens from being targeted by Exponential Age weapons, they are failing in their most fundamental obligations.

The military is rebalancing its priorities to prioritize cyber defense over expensive planes like the F-35. The US Department of Defense has updated its policy to defend forward and boost national defenses by strengthening the role of Cyber Command. Private companies own and run much of the digital infrastructure, meaning they are often responsible for identifying and responding to cyberattacks. Increasing public accountability of these companies could boost their security. Microsoft has embraced its role in preventing malicious attacks with its Digital Geneva Convention initiative.

The Digital Geneva Convention aims to engage governments and private companies to protect civilian security. Digital literacy and media literacy are crucial for citizens to operate safely in the digital world, including digital hygiene and critical thinking skills. Finland and Taiwan are leading the way in promoting these skills, with Finland emphasizing a coherent response to disinformation and Taiwan dealing with an often-hostile neighboring state.

Taiwan's digital minister suggests teaching media competence to be producers of data and narratives instead of just readers to combat China's misinformation strategy. Stronger defenses and de-escalation tactics are necessary to reduce the likelihood of foreign attacks and prevent them from spiraling out of control. Learning from the Cold War, building trust through effective communication between superpowers' leaders can be an important measure in preventing small miscommunications from causing disasters. Policymakers should establish a similar network of communication fit for the digital age to prevent cyberattacks from escalating.

New rules of engagement and methods of escalation and de-escalation are needed in the young domain of cyber conflict, as defending forward increases the chances of misunderstandings or conflagration. Clear norms and doctrines like NATO's Article 5 can prevent conflicts from escalating accidentally, but lines have become blurred during the Exponential Age. Non-proliferation measures like treaties and bans could make certain forms of attack unacceptable, as seen with chemical and biological weapons, landmines, and cluster bombs. A set of non-proliferation treaties fit for the digital age could target hacking and ban private companies from manufacturing commercially available hacking software.

The use of autonomous weapons and exponential technologies in warfare is increasing and poses a threat to international order and safety. Private firms like NSO Group develop malicious software such as Pegasus, which has allegedly been used to spy on journalists and activists. A legal framework is needed to govern the use of autonomous weapons, and human control must remain an important aspect of weapons design, operation, and governance. Inaction is not an option, and new systems of defense and de-escalation are necessary to prevent a messy battlefield. The primary goal of any sovereign nation is to protect its citizens from violent threats.

Exponential technology is unsettling various areas of our lives, including the relationship between consumers and markets, and citizens and society. The story of Facebook removing a photo of a famous anti-war photograph for breaching policies on child pornography is an example of how technology can impact society. The incident led to a public outcry and global media coverage, causing Facebook to eventually reverse its decision. More needs to be done to ensure that the society we inhabit is worth defending.

Facebook's power over public discourse became apparent in controversies over Russian interference in the US election and censorship decisions. Mark Zuckerberg's influence and control over Facebook is immense, as he profits from the company and has near-absolute control over it. His control extends to configuring algorithms, determining content visibility, privacy settings, and deciding which messages get delivered. This analysis reveals the impact of exponential technologies on the citizen-society relationship, particularly in the market.

While buying and selling is generally efficient for supplying goods and services, there are some things that cannot be bought or sold for ethical reasons, such as people or democratic institutions like public broadcasters. However, private companies are increasingly encroaching on these areas due to their exponential growth and expanding reach, leading to the privatisation of the public sphere. This trend is characterized by the emergence of new private rule-makers who exercise significant power in the public sphere, making democratic norms difficult to enforce.

The public sphere is increasingly dominated by private organizations, which make laws that govern our lives, and our public conversations are conducted on a small number of private platforms. Private companies monitor and claim ownership over personal information, which takes the form of data. The volume of real-time data generated in the global economy has exploded, but it is largely bought and sold for profit and used to profile and exploit individuals. Additionally, the way we interact with one another is becoming privatized.

Private platforms owned by a small number of oligopolistic companies are remoulding the ways we form social bonds and build communities, which may lead to an increasingly divided society. Power is shifting out of the hands of citizens and into those of technology executives, whose decisions often have harmful effects on society. Companies will continue to encroach ever further into the realms previously thought of as beyond the market, resulting in a fundamental rewiring of the relationship between citizen and society. The early internet's communitarian ideals inadvertently handed power to those who knew how to code and could harness the power of the nascent web for their own purposes.

Code has become a constraint on our behavior in the digital realm, regulating and implementing values that can enable or disable freedoms and protect or promote monitoring. The power to decide how cyberspace regulates lies with coders, and collectively, we can either have a role in their choice or allow them to select our values for us. Developers have become the rule-makers of the digital world, with big corporations determining laws that are arguably more unaccountable than predicted by Lessig. The shape of technology companies has changed, with engineering culture no longer calling the shots.

The power of coders and their bosses in shaping code and policies has implications for who the lawmakers are and what ideas can get into the public conversation. Private actors, such as tech companies, are becoming increasingly powerful in making rules about what can and can't be done, and they can become the censors. Facebook, for example, started with dorm-room thinking, which became the global standard, and exported particular sociocultural qualities to societies where such questions were inappropriate or meaningless.

The article discusses how code has become law in today's society, citing examples such as the use of smartphones for contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple and Google made design decisions prioritizing privacy over government surveillance, enabling governments to build more effective contact-tracing apps, but also determining what they could and could not do. The article questions whether decisions like this should be taking place in the private realm without a clear process of accountability.

The article discusses the concentration of power in the hands of a few technology executives who decide what makes it into the public sphere and what doesn't, leading to issues of censorship. While the internet has set the public sphere free, it is paradoxically increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few people, particularly Facebook and Twitter, due to the network effect. These platforms can censor or promote what they choose based on what is good for business, not society. The article cites examples of censorship and a lack of censorship leading to violence.

The article argues that unaccountable companies like Facebook have too much control over what ideas are circulated and how. Facebook's actions, such as limiting message forwarding after the Indian killings and banning Trump's accounts after the Capitol riot, demonstrate the arbitrary nature of what is deemed acceptable content. However, Facebook's response to the Myanmar military's use of its platform to incite violence against the Rohingya minority and allowing a page promoting armed response to stay visible prior to the Kenosha shootings are problematic. Overall, Facebook's actions have transformed the way ideas enter the public sphere and changed what people can say to each other on platforms like WhatsApp.

The article discusses how social media platforms like Facebook have the power to control public conversation based on their terms of service and commercial incentives. The banning of Trump's accounts raised questions about the inconsistent application of censorship policies, and the article argues that private companies should not be the ones handling such important issues. Facebook's creation of an Oversight Board is a positive step, but there is a need for clear guidance from democratically accountable lawmakers to determine censorship frameworks. Overall, the article raises concerns about the power of exponential age companies to make up their own rules.

In the Exponential Age, our digital data has become privatised and businesses use it to gain power over us. Our personal data can be used to manipulate our behaviour, profile us, and target us with messages. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation considers each of us to be data subjects, but we may have also become subjects of data. The ways in which companies track our behaviour and generate data from it are becoming more complex.

Google's AdWords advertising system triggered a gold rush for data in 2000, allowing companies to gather more information about individual behavior. This led to innovative and unscrupulous ways of extracting data. Over time, users visiting a few websites could be tracked by hundreds of organizations, each gathering as much information as possible about them.

The vast amount of data created by digital technologies, including personal information collected by companies like Facebook, is often stored without regard for its usefulness. The data sphere continues to grow exponentially as new technologies emerge that generate even more information about individuals, including health data, neural activity, and environmental sensors. The increasing processing power of computers will only amplify the ability to collect and analyze this data.

While the collection of data has many beneficial effects, such as accurately predicting risk and broadening access to financial services, there are risks associated with inaccurate or breached data that works against us. Companies like 23andMe offer low-cost gene sequencing that reveals personal information, but the data collected may not always be used for our benefit. It is important to consider whether data is gathered for our benefit or the benefit of the corporations collecting it.

23andMe has a large genomic data set that can help identify genetic drivers of diseases, but they can sell this data and change their policies. Genetic testing is not covered by healthcare data protection laws and is instead subject to voluntary guidelines. Personal data can be used to stigmatize and demographically profile individuals, as seen in China's social credit system. The lack of consistent business practices in China has led to a lack of independent credit bureaux.

Social credit scores based on masses of data can help overcome the crisis of trust, but also have dystopian implications. Companies use data to profile us, leading to prejudice and racial bias. As personal data is sold for profit, these problems will increase, and individuals are being measured in a data economy. Sociologically, opposites do not attract.

Homophily is the tendency for people to group with those who are similar to them. While this trait makes life easier, it can lead to social breakdown and democratic sclerosis if allowed to get out of control. Increasingly, communities are being formed online, under the control of a few digital giants, risking homophily spiraling out of control. This poses a problem for citizens in the Exponential Age. Homophily is not new, but it needs to be balanced to prevent negative consequences.

Online networks are designed to link people with common traits, making them more homophilous and clustered than society. This is driven by a commercial incentive to group similar people into precise, discrete segments, but it can lead to pushing people into isolated and extreme groups. Recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube and Facebook promote progressively more extreme material to keep users engaged, potentially making them one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century. A large-scale study of YouTube found that users consistently migrate from milder to more extreme content.

Facebook's recommendation tools inadvertently connect extremists and terrorists, leading people to violence through radicalisation pathways. The company has recognised the issue and launched integrity teams to tackle it, but internal research shows that right-wing and racist extremism is still prevalent on the platform, with 64% of people joining extremist groups due to Facebook's recommendation algorithms exploiting the human brain's attraction to divisiveness.

The problem of homophily, where people are gradually pulled into more extreme communities, is exacerbated by technology such as Facebook's recommendation algorithms that exploit the human brain's attraction to divisiveness. New exponential technologies like genomic prediction could further exacerbate this problem by allowing parents to pick children who look or think like them, eroding the shared experiences and values that bind us together. This is the era of the second enclosure, where formerly common property is being commodified through new property rights, potentially destroying the social fabric that holds us together.

The public conversation is happening on private platforms where personal data is bought and sold. Corporations dictate how we socialize, limiting our ability to be good citizens and uphold democratic institutions. New rules are needed to hold corporations accountable, and democratic politics should determine these rules. We need to identify broad principles for the relationship between citizens and the market, including transparency and the ability to scrutinize digital network content flows.

There is a need for clear and explicit rules on what speech is acceptable on social platforms, but the rules are currently made in private. External oversight is necessary for the outcomes of this process, including algorithm operations. The potential harms of digital networks need regular inspection, and the process should not be behind closed doors. Examples from other sectors, such as aircraft safety, can be used to inform digital infrastructure safety.

The concept of interoperability, where different computer systems should be compatible and users can carry data from one platform to another, can limit the growth of superstar companies and give citizens more choice. It can also force competing platforms to behave better. The dominant social networks were more open until 2016, allowing users to access their data from different platforms without needing permission from the networks themselves. However, with interoperability, users can still act in the digital social space without being restricted to a single platform.

The dominance of major social networks suffocated interoperability as they made their systems deliberately incompatible. However, interoperability can redress the power imbalance between large platform companies and individuals, as it allows users to leave a particular provider without losing the ability to reach all of their friends still using the original service. Governments can mandate interoperability for services that reach a certain size, which would require companies to make their systems compatible. This would require decisive action from governments.

Interoperability allows data to be unshackled from one service and helps diminish the control of tech giants. However, the use of data is a topic of debate, with some advocating for treating data as property and compensating people for it. The author believes that further monetizing personal data is not the solution to the problem, as the creeping monetization of private life is the issue.

Individual data is worth little, and new rights are needed for individuals to have authority and oversight over their data. These rights include security against surveillance, protection against surreptitious behavior manipulation, and prevention of unfair discrimination based on data. A digital bill of rights could be created, but it would only be a reactive mechanism. To entitle individuals to the true benefits of data, data must be shared more widely, as it is only useful in aggregate.

Organizing data in a way that benefits society requires a fundamental shift in the relationship between public and private entities. The market/state binary is flawed, and there are often more productive ways to organize resources. The Tragedy of the Commons, which states that freely available resources will be overused, was used by free marketers to argue that state intervention is bad. However, political economist Elinor Ostrom's work won a Nobel Prize for demonstrating that shared resources can be well-stewarded without privatization or nationalization.

Real commons, such as grazing lands, can be well-managed by a patchwork of formal and informal norms for the benefit of those who use them. A fourth principle, commonality, is needed to create new commons in the Exponential Age to prevent the private sector's creeping power. Digital assets are particularly prone to management by the commons, as they are accessible and do not get used up. Data commons, such as the UK Biobank, already exist, and allow trusted access to shared resources for the benefit of society, rather than commercial gain.

Commons approaches can be used to manage and produce shared assets, such as open-source software and Wikipedia, through collective management by volunteers. These projects have proven to be successful and bring social benefits. The four prescriptions of transparency, interoperability, rights, and commons offer a new way of thinking about the relationship between citizen and market, addressing the problem of digital infrastructure in modern society.

Unchecked power in the hands of private companies threatens the citizenship and governance of individuals in the Exponential Age. The four approaches discussed aim to limit this power and return it to the hands of the people. Urgent questions of governance and representation arise as new technologies give untold influence to a few companies. The control must be put in the hands of exponential citizens acting in their collective interest. The importance of open-access repositories such as GenBank is highlighted in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 virus was identified in Wuhan, and scientists around the world began exploring it and developing vaccines. Within a year, seven effective vaccines had been approved and nearly 24 million people had received a vaccine shot. The speed of vaccine development was unprecedented in human history due to the global crisis caused by the virus. The disease spread rapidly, causing millions of deaths globally within a year.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant social and economic turmoil, with most countries going into some form of lockdown. However, the response to the virus was also characterized by the transformative power of recent technologies, particularly genome sequencers and machine learning. Moderna's vaccine was developed using modified mRNA and machine learning, and the process is a virtuous cycle that allows for the creation of better algorithms and medication.

Digital platforms compressed years of testing and recruitment for vaccine trials into just hours, while databases, online booking systems, and text messages were used to speed up the vaccination rate during the pandemic. Exponential technologies also defined cultural and social responses to the pandemic, with misinformation spreading quickly on social networks, driven by the contagiousness of Covid misinformation on different social networks. During lockdowns, the internet provided creature comforts and online delivery services, such as Netflix, DoorDash, and Deliveroo, to make life easier.

The Covid-19 pandemic caused a shift to remote work and learning, with Zoom becoming the standard for videoconferencing. Many of the services that became essential during the pandemic were less than a decade old, and the pandemic showcased the power of exponential technology. Exponential technologies provide more from less each year and drive greater efficiencies, leading to more transformative technologies and connected networks of trade and information. The shift toward exponential technology shows no signs of slowing down as new technologies continue to improve.

The Exponential Age will continue to accelerate with technological advancements and social transformations. Predicting the long-term implications of these changes is difficult, but exponential technologies are likely to significantly shape our lives. Computing power is expected to be at least 100 times cheaper in a decade, and understanding its implications is challenging, much like predicting how electricity would be used a century ago. The significant growth in computing power is likely to create a similar impact to the rapid growth of electricity consumption.

Renewable energy is expected to be dominant, with solar and wind power becoming five times cheaper in a decade. Fossil fuel use is declining, with synthetic biology offering alternatives for pharmaceuticals and oil-derived materials. Human genome sequencing will be affordable, with wearable devices and regular testing enabling early detection of health conditions. Nanosatellites may help track natural resources and deforestation rates.

Advances in technology offer new possibilities and an age of abundance where energy, food, and computation will be cheaply produced. However, an abundance of resources does not mean an absence of waste, and cheaper technologies may lead to increased demand and excessive resource extraction. To tackle issues like climate change, it is important to have the right governance in place. Vertical farming could reduce resource dependence and provide healthier food to cities.

Exponential technology brings new concerns such as destabilization of established systems, uneven distribution of negative effects, and a shift in power towards powerful companies and individuals. The exponential gap suggests a world changing faster than our systems can handle, and these forces may lead to dystopia. This includes constant military conflict, hyper-commodified public sphere, and powerful firms and powerless workers.

The article discusses the misconception that technology alone drives social change and proposes a shift in mindset to put technology back in the service of society. The author argues that we have agency over where technology takes us and that the direction, shape, and impact of technology are not preordained. The use of technologies varies across societies, and we are the ones who decide what we want from the tools we build. The article cites examples such as the use of DDT and gig work to support this argument.

The article argues that technology is not preordained and that it is our choices and circumstances that determine how it is used. The direction of technology can be shaped, but it will bring rapid and unexpected dislocations that must be managed. The article emphasizes the need to channel and direct the disruptive power of technology, which functions as an instrument of governance and moulds ethical, legal, and social systems. To close the exponential gap, the article suggests a shift in mindset, policies, social movements, and new forms of political and economic organization.

Exponential technology impacts politics, economy, and society. Increasingly dominant firms require new regulatory and societal expectations, while the rise of platforms erodes the relationship between employers and workers. Collective action is necessary to empower workers, whether gig or formally employed, with dignity, flexibility, and security. Regional economies will become more independent, while cities will grow in stature, leaving rural and small-town areas at risk of being left behind. Issues previously considered national are becoming regional or even local, requiring new solutions.

The structure of power needs to change to reflect the impact of exponential technology, and new organizations are needed to maintain international cooperation. The return to the local could lead to conflict, exacerbated by new technologies. Nations need to strengthen their defenses and teach populations to be resilient to attacks while rethinking the relationship between citizen and society. New rules and norms of war are needed to de-escalate conflicts and prevent the proliferation of new weapons. Common ownership and control systems would allow communities to harness the power of exponential technology. Unifying themes include commonality, societal organization, and public good. New tools are needed to manage the transition into the Exponential Age.

The book proposes building institutions that promote cooperation, interoperability, and resilience in the face of rapid change. Cooperation is needed for disparate groups to work together, while interoperability ensures easy use of services from different suppliers. Resilient systems, such as the Danish flexicurity model, are necessary for institutions to withstand constant change. Flexibility is also crucial for institutions to adapt quickly to changing societal needs. All organizations need to prioritize resilience and flexibility, rather than treating them as afterthoughts.

The book argues that institutions have been slow to adapt to the changing technological landscape and need to prioritize flexibility in order to keep up. Suggestions for adapting include increasing transparency in big tech and decentralizing power to local levels. The author suggests that the industrial age brought about social institutions that adapted to new technologies, but the Exponential Age requires a new social settlement that prioritizes commonality, resilience, and flexibility. The principles in the book are aimed at making institutions function in an era of constant change.

The Exponential Age is characterized by unpredictable technological innovations and their interactions with various aspects of society, but humans have historically found ways to thrive and control technology for good.
