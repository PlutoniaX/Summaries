The book "Competing in the Age of AI" discusses how artificial intelligence is transforming the economy, companies, and competition. It explores the need for a new operating architecture and strategy to leverage the power of data and networks. The book also addresses the ethical challenges and implications of the age of AI and the new set of challenges for leaders in various institutions. The text starts with an example of how AI can create a new Rembrandt painting based on data and algorithms.



 Scientists, engineers, and Rembrandt experts used learning algorithms to create a new painting imitating the artist's style via artificial intelligence. 

 AI is expanding the range of artistic possibilities and transforming the process of creating art. 

 Google's Arts and Machine Intelligence program explores how AI is transforming creative practices across various media. 

 AI is being used to create completely new works of art, such as AICAN, an art-generating algorithm that produces paintings inspired by established styles but entirely new.



 AI algorithms model the course of art history, offering insight into art's progression from figuration to abstraction. 

 AI is becoming pervasive and is transforming the nature of organizations and the ways they shape the world. 

 The first profound implications of AI may be transforming the nature of companies and how they compete. 

 AI is becoming the new operational foundation of business, defining how companies drive the execution of tasks.

Computers are now performing tasks that traditionally required human intelligence to design and execute, with significant ramifications for scalability, scope, and learning in digital, AI-driven processes. Networks and AI are reshaping the operational foundations of firms and erasing deep-seated limits to growth. Even weak AI is enough to transform the nature of firms and how they operate, as demonstrated by the explosive growth of firms like Facebook and Tencent.

The emergence of digital operating models driven by AI is transforming competition and changing how industries function. In this new age, traditional assumptions about strategy and leadership no longer apply. Digital disruption has previously created new opportunities without transforming the economy, but the invention of digital photography represents a case where digital technology dramatically transformed an industry and created new opportunities.



 Digitizing photography transformed the nature of photography and created opportunities for new businesses. It made it easy and free to share pictures, leading to a rise of companies with scalable digital models. The vast number of photos taken daily is a growing dataset that is powering the improvement of AI algorithms used for facial recognition, photo sorting, and image enhancement. Social platforms can now automatically identify family and friends, as well as affinities and backgrounds. Photo apps are already recommending products, services, and news feeds that users might like.



 Digitizing photography enabled the emergence of a new breed of powerful companies with a different operating model that competes in different ways. Digital representation is infinitely scalable, connectable, and embeds processing instructions that shape behavior and enable a variety of possible paths and responses. This completely transforms the ways a firm can and should operate, and firms are now designed to release the full potential of digital networks, data, algorithms, and AI.

Digital operating models can improve a firm's scalability and create more value, but can also pose new risks such as privacy, cybersecurity, and bias. Traditional companies that cannot adapt may lose out to digital competitors such as Facebook, Tencent, and Google. These digital companies have a fundamentally different way of creating and capturing value and rely on a different operating model.

Digital firms like Amazon can leverage their operating models to transform traditional industries, but they require new approaches to leadership, regulation, and ethics. Amazon's use of digital technology, analytics, and AI/ML allows them to scale, extend their scope, and learn, and in colliding with traditional businesses, they change the rules of competition. Traditional businesses face limits on the advantages of scale due to their operating models becoming increasingly complex, which can lead to problems with operational costs and service levels.

Amazon's digitized systems offer advantages in terms of scalability, scope, and learning. As more processes and tasks are digitized, the enterprise becomes more scalable and capable of delivering a wider range of products and services. Amazon's algorithm for product suggestions benefits from ingesting huge amounts of data on customer behavior, and its performance continues to improve with more data and diversity of products. The system learns and improves with every relevant consumer and product, offering pinpointed targeting.

Amazon's operating model centers on digitizing operational excellence through the application of AI, machine learning, and robotics, and deploying people on the edge of the digital network. Computers define what humans should do, minimizing managerial complexity and maximizing the impact of digital scalability. Amazon's service improves with volume, while traditional businesses run into complexity costs, resulting in the transformation of industries.

Amazon's Echo device, equipped with the Alexa voice interface, has transformed many traditional tasks and continues to expand its functionality. Alexa has over 50,000 skills and is designed to connect users to a virtually limitless array of services and products. Amazon's algorithms learn from user data to predict their needs and create personalized experiences. Amazon's model is scaling well, disrupting traditional industries and becoming a driver of industry transformation. Its impact continues to grow as it reaches scale in more markets.

Amazon's continued growth and transformation are facing increasing scrutiny from regulators. Sustainable growth for Amazon will depend on its ability to balance consumer benefits against potential economic dislocations. In retail, Amazon's formidable challenge has led to the bankruptcy of long-standing retailers, and even Walmart is rearchitecting its operating model to confront Amazon with a digital and AI-enabled foundation. Traditional siloed systems are being replaced by an integrated, cloud-based architecture, exposing unique data assets to new applications for enhanced or automated tasks.

Walmart is using data analytics and AI to drive growth and transformation and has acquired digital firms, partnered with Microsoft, and launched an Intelligent Retail Lab to improve the in-store experience. Walmart aims to bring the convenience of online shopping to stores by deploying cameras, sensors, and deep learning software to capture customer movement and provide personalized recommendations and product choices. Walmart's online revenues have grown substantially, but it needs to transform its physical retail experience to complement the online experience and sustain its performance.

Retailers like Walmart are using data analytics and AI to track customer patterns and personalize the in-store experience. Real-time information from personal devices can be integrated with past online interactions to recognize customers and offer recommendations. However, implementation poses challenges around privacy and the role of salespeople. Amazon Go stores have no cashiers and no lines, relying on technology to track purchases. The digitally-enabled supply chain may become the bottleneck in building more stores.

The use of digital technology is reshaping various businesses, professions, and applications worldwide. Tencent, the maker of the WeChat app, is one of the companies driving this change, with WeChat and Alipay being the preferred mode of payment in stores and restaurants across Asia. Even beggars and street performers are accepting digital payments. The adoption of digital systems is making scaling to multiple operations virtually cost-free, as seen with JD.com's thousands of convenience stores in China.

Tencent is a Chinese company that created the messaging service Open ICQ in 1999, which quickly became the country's largest instant messaging and social network. Tencent monetized its messaging network through advertising and premium offerings and extended the platform with WeChat in 2011. WeChat provided users with additional functionalities like sending and receiving money and easy access to external services through APIs. Tencent's digital operating model leverages a data platform for analytics and AI opportunities, enabling the company to expand into new markets and transform industries. Tencent competes with Alipay, part of Ant Financial Services Group, and both companies are leveraging their connections with large consumer masses to disrupt various industries.

Tencent and Ant Financial offer a wide range of continuously improving products and services, including payment services, money market funds, and small business loans. They have ten times more consumers than the largest banks in the US and Europe, making them a crucial hub in the global economy. As with Amazon, regulators are starting to pay serious attention. The emergence of digital networks and AI can challenge long-standing assumptions about the nature of work, firms, and institutions. AI can render skills and talents obsolete, while digital networks can change traditional activities.

The broad deployment of AI could threaten millions of jobs and cybersecurity has become a central problem for organizations. The digital and analog worlds are becoming one, transforming business and society. This book aims to help leaders understand and manage the potential impact of digital operating models, both in new and old firms, by leveraging existing strengths in new ways and transforming operating capabilities to support new strategies. Firms can find new growth and opportunity by building a new runtime.

Several firms including Mastercard, Fidelity Investments, Walmart, and Roche are investing in AI and changing their operations. AI presents new opportunities for startups, established firms, and even artists. The frameworks described in the book can be used to digitize and enable new processes through analytics and AI. AI-driven transformation prompts the creation of new companies and motivates old companies to lead again, adopting new operating models while appreciating traditional systems. The authors provide a set of frameworks for understanding, competing, and operating in the age of AI, based on their past decade of research at Harvard Business School and involvement in hundreds of strategy and transformation efforts.

The authors engaged with a diverse range of organizations, from startups to multinational corporations, and distilled what they have learned into this book. The book addresses the observation that a new breed of digital firms is eclipsing traditional managerial methods and transforming the economy, and explains the need for traditional firms to rearchitect how they work and use data to confront this threat. The authors acknowledge the foundations built by others, including Carliss Baldwin, Kim Clark, Hal Varian, and Carl Shapiro.

The book discusses the emergence of a new type of firm, driven by digital networks, AI, and software. It describes the implications of this new age of AI for strategy and leadership, targeting managers, entrepreneurs, and society as a whole. The book is divided into ten chapters, with chapter 2 examining a new concept of the firm using three digital unicorns as examples. Chapter 3 focuses on the core of the new firm, using Netflix as an example and exploring three critical factory components: AI algorithms, data pipelines, and decision-making.

Chapter 4 explains the need for a new operating architecture to exploit AI, using Amazon as an example. Chapter 5 discusses the transformation journey of becoming an AI company, with examples and research on enterprise AI implementation scenarios. Chapter 6 examines the strategic implications of digital networks and AI, while Chapter 7 focuses on competitive dynamics when digital operating models compete with traditional firms. Chapter 8 discusses the ethics of AI, including issues of fairness, privacy, and responsibility.

The book "Digital Scale, Scope, and Learning" discusses the ethical challenges of digital networks and AI, including algorithmic bias and data security. It also outlines the new rules defining the AI era and provides insights for leaders of both traditional and digital firms. The book encourages organizations to invest in AI-powered transformation to identify opportunities and thrive in the digital age.

The text discusses how legacy and new companies can embrace AI-powered transformation to achieve sustainable growth and opportunity. Ant Financial, a Chinese fintech firm, is used as an example of a company that leverages data to deliver digital services and achieve success. The ability to learn from data and respond with digital services is identified as a key factor in the success of firms in the AI era.

Ant Financial is using an integrated platform with AI to transform financial services and compete with traditional industry incumbents. The company employs fewer than 10,000 people to serve more than 700 million customers. The chapter explores three rapidly growing examples of this new template for the twenty-first-century digital firm: Ant Financial, Ocado, and Peloton. These companies use software, data, and AI as the primary operational foundation to create new business models, reshape how firms operate, and transform the economy. Google is another established firm that has placed AI at the core of its business and operations. The chapter analyzes how these companies are forging a new path by breaking down a firm into its business and operating models and analyzing how it has traditionally shaped and executed on its value proposition.

Firms are needed to coordinate joint production tasks without prohibitive transaction costs. Firms provide long-term contracts to coordinate tasks, without continually incurring friction. The value of a firm is shaped by its business model, which defines how it promises to create and capture value, and its operating model, which encompasses the systems, processes, and capabilities that enable the delivery of goods and services to customers. The business model concerns value creation and capture, while the operating model is the actual enabler of firm value and its ultimate constraint.

The value proposition or customer promise of a company lies in the particular problem they solve for customers. Factors contributing to value creation can include quality, styling, comfort, ride quality, cost, and brand. Different companies create different values, such as a car company providing transportation versus a ride-sharing company providing on-demand rides. A company's approach to value creation requires choosing the precise problem they solve for the customer and their positioning in the marketplace. Value creation for ride-sharing companies also relies on an ecosystem of drivers and riders.

Value capture is the other side of the coin in value creation, where a company captures less value from a customer than it creates for them. An auto company's value capture relies on the margin between sales price and manufacturing cost, while a ride-sharing company's value capture is based on pay-per-use. Digital firms innovate their business models by experimenting with various aspects of value creation and capture, often coming from different stakeholders. In a fully digitized business, value creation and capture can be separated more easily, as seen in Google's free services and value capture from advertisers.



 Business model innovation requires a consistent operating model to deliver promised value to customers. 

 The operating model is the plan to achieve value creation and capture, and it shapes the actual value of the firm. 

 Operating models are complex but have simple goals: deliver value at scale, achieve sufficient scope, and engage in sufficient learning. 

 The main challenges faced by executives are to drive economies of scale and scope, and to learn and innovate.



 Firms are structured to efficiently provide more goods and services than individuals can. 

 Scope refers to a firm's range of activities and economies of scope enable corporations to establish multiple lines of business. 

 The learning function of an operating model is essential for continuous improvement and developing new products and services.

The alignment between a company's business model and operating model is important for optimizing performance, with the resources of the firm deployed to optimize what it seeks to do. The expansion of scale, scope, and learning increases the complexity of traditional operating models, creating operational constraints that limit the value created and captured by firms. However, digital firms are deploying a new kind of operating model that is reaching new levels of scalability, achieving a broader scope, and learning and adapting at a faster rate than traditional firms, by transforming the critical path in the delivery of value.

Ant Financial, a payment platform created by Alibaba, has transformed the traditional escrow system into an efficient financial payment service that facilitates transactions between merchants and buyers. The system helped alleviate consumer distrust of online shopping, driving early growth for Alibaba. Ant Financial's business model is built on offering a substitute for trust and creating value for two categories of customers: consumers and merchants. Value capture occurs through a transaction fee.

Alipay, a Chinese online payment platform, charges merchants a transaction fee and aims to increase transaction flow by increasing the number of buyers and sellers. As the number of merchants and buyers increases, a positive feedback loop is created, amplifying the value of the service. Alipay's growth was exponential after its launch beyond Alibaba's shopping platform, and the platform enabled cashless transactions via the Alipay app and QR codes. Alipay takes a 0.6 percent cut of the transaction.

Alipay, a Chinese online payment platform, offers users the ability to make various types of transactions beyond online shopping, including paying bills and splitting restaurant bills. The platform was spun off from Alibaba by CEO Jack Ma and became the first product in the portfolio of Ant Financial. Alipay and its rival WeChat Pay grew rapidly and dominated China's financial services market, which was largely unattractive to traditional banks. Ant Financial expanded its services to clients and the larger ecosystem, including Yue Bao, an investment platform that allows Alipay users to earn interest.

Ant Financial, a subsidiary of Alibaba, launched Yue Bao, a mobile money market fund, that garnered over a million users and became the largest money market fund in the world in just nine months, with over $81 billion in assets. Ant Financial also extended its financial services to include personal investment and wealth management, social credit scoring, internet banking, insurance, and more. Its ecosystem of services led to dramatic increases in its user base and engagement, dominating much of the Chinese financial services market with over 700 million users and controlling 54% of mobile payments.

Ant Financial and its Alipay service dominate the Chinese financial services market with over 700 million users, controlling 54% of mobile payments. Ant Financial's digital operating model is built on AI-enabled digital automation and the company expanded globally with investments in mobile payment systems in Asia, partnerships, and acquisitions. However, its attempt to penetrate the US market with a $1.2 billion purchase of MoneyGram was thwarted due to national security concerns.

Ant Financial's MYbank uses data analytics, including information on communication frequency and type, to assess relationship quality before approving loans for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs. With its cloud computing infrastructure, the company can process loans at a significantly lower cost compared to traditional banks. MYbank does not require physical locations or a large workforce, as its operating model relies on a sophisticated, integrated data platform that collects information on users' transactions and preferences to drive personalization, revenue optimization, and recommendations. Alipay, which is used to ensure trust, also uses data and AI.

Alipay uses five layers of real-time digital checks, including algorithms that analyze buyer and seller account information and device data, to ensure the validity of transactions. Ant Financial relies on data from internal consumer behavior statistics, transaction data from sellers on Alibaba's platforms, public data, and data from partners to power Zhima credit scores. The company uses this data to compare good borrowers with bad ones and isolate common traits to calculate credit scores automatically in real-time for all borrowers. The algorithms used to calculate credit scores improve in real-time with every iteration.

Ant Financial, the financial services arm of Alibaba, utilizes a sophisticated data-driven operating model to provide perks and loans to consumers with good credit and require additional deposits from those with low credit scores. The company employs an AI-driven fraud prevention monitoring system and a sophisticated experimentation platform to rapidly develop new products and services. Ant Financial's dramatic expansion is attributed to its agile innovation and scenario-based prototyping, and it leverages data mining and semantic analysis to automate customer issue resolution. The company aims to remove the human bottleneck in its operations.

The digital operating model avoids direct human intervention in the product or service delivery process by digitizing customer value processes through a centralized data architecture. Many new operating models automate data-driven actions and gradually remove human tasks from delivery bottlenecks, such as shopping on the Amazon mobile app. Removing human and organizational bottlenecks from the critical path has significant advantages.



 A digital operating model is easier to scale with minimal marginal cost and less dependence on human actors and organizational constraints. 

 Digital technologies enable easy business connections and processes can be plugged into external networks to provide additional value. 

 Digitizing the operating model enables faster learning and innovation through accumulated data and smaller, more agile product teams. 

 In a digital operating model, employees are not the primary deliverers of value.



 In a digital operating model, employees design and oversee a software-automated, algorithm-driven organization that delivers the goods. 

 Peloton founder John Foley transformed the traditional stationary bicycle into a digital product with a sleek, high-quality indoor bicycle and integrated tablet displaying fitness programming. 

 Foley's experience competing with Amazon as CEO at Barnes & Noble taught him to transform traditional categories digitally rather than compete with superior scale and AI capabilities.

Peloton's business model offers customers an in-home fitness experience with access to live and on-demand studio classes for a monthly subscription fee. The company's approach adds digital content, data, analytics, and connectivity to a traditional industry, which enhances value creation by giving users access to an unlimited number of classes and a community of fellow members. Peloton's model is different from traditional gyms and home fitness equipment makers, who rely on subscription models and personal investments, respectively.

Peloton's business model includes creating subcommunities around instructors and other training styles, offering a communal experience through leader boards, virtual high-fives, and live connections among exercisers. The company's value capture model combines product sales and subscriptions, with a high subscription renewal rate of 95%. Peloton scales the fitness experience through live-streamed classes with up to 200,000 riders and expanded its offerings beyond cycling to include yoga, strength training, and treadmill workouts.

Peloton is a product-focused company that designed an "iPhone of fitness equipment." Its success is due to its product, software, and digital service, which delivers a scalable experience to a rapidly growing audience. Peloton employs over 70 software engineers and built its own supply chain. Its growth bottlenecks are shifted to internal digitized systems or to resources outside the firm, and its APIs easily expand the scope of the business.

Peloton has built a sophisticated analytics platform that gathers extensive data, which it constantly analyzes to drive user experience, enhance engagement, and reduce customer churn. Its data stores provide a range of options to redefine what it means to be a fitness company. Peloton has scaled fast, reaching over $700 million in revenue and a $4 billion valuation on an approximately $1 billion investment. In comparison, the online grocery delivery business is challenging, and it took many years for Ocado to win the respect of customers and investors.

Ocado, a UK-based online grocery delivery company, has become successful in the financial markets due to its use of data, AI, and robotics in its business and operating model. Its centralized data platform, rebuilt in 2014, provides detailed information on products, customers, partners, supply chain, and delivery environment. AI algorithms optimize routing and ensure fresh product delivery. Ocado is essentially an AI company disguised as a supply chain company disguised as an online grocer.

Ocado's AI predicts when customers will order products, and algorithms coordinate the refrigerated trucks and warehouses, where bots pick, assemble, and transport groceries. The warehouses are a masterpiece of AI technology, flexible to accommodate expansion, and the system is continually learning and innovating. Human labor is still used for certain tasks that bots struggle with.

Ocado, a UK-based online retail company, is using AI and digital capabilities to automate its processes and offer its technology platform to third-party retail and delivery services. They are also expanding internationally and partnering with companies like Kroger in the US. With a revenue of almost $2 billion and a valuation of around $7 billion, Ocado is transforming value creation, capture, and delivery. The company is less transactional and more focused on using digital technology to foster consumer loyalty and engagement.

Ant Financial, Ocado, and Peloton have digitized their critical operating processes and built unique capabilities and approaches to transform their industries. Each company uses algorithms and networks to transform their markets, but in a unique way. Ant Financial uses impressive capabilities in analytics and AI to drive unprecedented scale and scope, while Ocado features an operating model that deploys sophisticated AI to drive impressive scalability, sustain a broad scope of product offerings, and enable ongoing learning and innovation. Peloton is driven more by networks and community, using data and analytics to enhance engagement and loyalty. The operating models of these firms have similarities as they digitize critical processes.

The adoption of AI as a core technology removes growth bottlenecks and enables scalability and learning. Google's CEO announced a shift to an AI-first strategic focus, making AI the common foundation across virtually every operating process. AI is becoming central to the business and operating models of many companies.

Google's CEO announced a shift to an AI-first strategic focus, making AI essential to Google's business and operating models, with virtually every aspect of the company leveraging this core. Google's products and services would use conversational, ambient, and contextual AI to continuously learn and adapt, and ads would become increasingly personalized and contextualized. This announcement signaled the need for Google employees and partners to develop an in-depth understanding of AI and embed it in their own products and services. The core of the firm is becoming a scalable decision factory powered by software, data, and algorithms.

The Industrial Revolution transformed manufacturing with a scalable and repeatable approach. The age of AI is now industrializing data gathering, analytics, and decision making to create the AI factory, a scalable decision engine that powers the digital operating model of the 21st century firm. This allows for superior scale, scope, and learning capacity of the digital firm, where decision making is treated as an industrial process and is increasingly embedded in software. Digital operating models can manage flows of information or physical products.

The AI factory is at the core of the digital operating model, guiding critical processes and operating decisions while moving humans to the edge. It creates a virtuous cycle between user engagement, data collection, algorithm design, prediction, and improvement. The cycle involves integrating data from multiple sources to refine and train algorithms, which make predictions and improve their own accuracy. These predictions drive decisions and actions and are continuously tested and improved through experimentation. An example is the prediction cycles in a search engine like Google, where every user movement and click improves predictions for future searches.

The search results page is heavily influenced by data on previous searches, as well as an automated auction for relevant ads. The AI factory brings mass production methods to data processing and analytics, forming the core of a digital operating model. Netflix has harnessed the power of artificial intelligence to personalize the user experience, pick movie concepts, and negotiate content agreements.

Netflix recognized the importance of using data to improve the customer experience, and focused early efforts on developing a recommendation engine. With the launch of its streaming service, Netflix gained access to extensive behavioral data, which helped determine personalized movie recommendations, predict customer loyalty, and launch automatic queueing and recommendation functions. The company's customization and personalization is pervasive, with each user's Netflix experience personalized and customized. Netflix also uses data and AI algorithms to decide which content to create on its own.

Netflix was an early adopter of predictive analytics, using it initially to evaluate the potential of House of Cards. By 2010, the company was using AI to improve its recommendation engine and by 2014 had expanded its use of analytics to personalize the streaming experience for each user. Netflix has more than 150 million subscribers and a content library of over 5,500 shows. The essential components of Netflix's AI factory include a data pipeline, algorithm development, experimentation platform, and software infrastructure.

The AI factory's essential components include a data pipeline, algorithm development, experimentation platform, and software infrastructure. The data pipeline is the essential input for the AI factory, and it gathers, inputs, cleans, integrates, processes, and safeguards data in a systematic, sustainable, and scalable way. Netflix uses a broad base of data inputs, including item ratings, stream plays, metadata, and social data to improve its recommendation engine. The infrastructure delivers the data, and the algorithms are the machines that do the work, while the experimentation platform connects new fuel, pipes, and machines to existing operational systems.

Netflix uses both internal and external data to improve its features and personalize user experience, and processes millions of search terms entered by its members daily. The company generates and analyzes vast amounts of data to continuously adapt its service and create microclusters of taste communities connecting viewers with similar preferences. Datafication is a key aspect of Netflix's strategy.

Datafication has enabled the creation of new value in a range of settings, from controlling home temperature with Nest to tracking sleep with Oura rings. Combining external data sources can add further value, as seen in ride-sharing platforms' generation of unprecedented data about transportation preferences and traffic flow. Companies may need to invest in technology and services to generate useful data if it is not readily available.



Pitney Bowes is using its datafication strategy around physical addresses to offer data-driven Knowledge Fabric solutions to organizations for marketing, fraud detection and other purposes. 

Many businesses attempting to build AI factories find their data is fragmented, incomplete, and siloed in disparate IT systems. 

Executives at many incumbent companies underestimate the challenge and urgency of investing in cleaning and integrating data for an effective AI factory. 

After gathering data, much work remains to be done in cleaning, normalizing, and integrating it, as data assets are often plagued by biases and errors.



To feed complex analysis, different kinds of data must be normalized, particularly financial data to ensure accuracy in insight from integrated datasets. 

After data is gathered and prepared, the algorithm is developed to make the data useful and accurate for decision-making, prediction and problem-solving. 

Data proliferation and AI algorithm advances have lowered the cost of making accurate predictions, increasing the scope and intensity of their usage throughout the economy, benefiting the success of many organizations.

AI algorithms can be used for a wide range of applications, from simple predictions to complex image recognition and language translation. The foundations of algorithm design have been around for quite some time. Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are the three general approaches used to develop accurate predictions using statistical models. Supervised learning algorithms aim to predict outcomes as closely as possible to a human expert, relying on an expert-labeled dataset of potential characteristics or features.

In supervised learning, a labeled dataset is split between training and validation, and the algorithm's parameters are determined to predict outcomes. Supervised machine learning can predict binary outcomes or numerical quantities. The main challenge is to iterate between data, features, and algorithms until satisfied with the error rate between model and expert prediction. Examples include email spam filters and social media's friend tagging suggestions.

Supervised learning uses labeled data to make predictions, such as in the case of Nest thermostats or Netflix recommendations. Many companies have accumulated large amounts of algorithm-ready labeled data and can implement supervised machine learning to reduce fraud and processing time. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is used to discover insights in data without preconceptions. Companies are using medical data to correlate with health diagnoses and improve diagnoses using technology such as Zebra Medical Vision.

Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to find natural groupings in data without labels and uncover structures that may not be obvious to the observer. They are useful for gaining insights from social media postings, identifying customer groups and sentiment patterns, creating customer segments, and categorizing reasons for customer churn. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not suggest specific labels but establishes the most robust statistical groupings, leaving humans or other algorithms to label the patterns and decide on potential actions.

The text discusses three types of unsupervised learning: clustering, association rule mining, and anomaly detection. Cluster analysis is used to group data into segments, while association rule mining looks for co-occurrence among items to create recommendations. Anomaly detection involves identifying unusual observations. These techniques are used in various industries such as retail, media, and customer service to gain insights from data.

The text discusses reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning that requires a starting point and a performance function. The algorithm explores different options to improve performance, balancing between exploration and exploitation. Reinforcement learning has potential applications in various industries. An example is how Netflix uses the algorithm to personalize movie recommendations and visuals.

Netflix uses a process of exploration and exploitation to improve user recommendations by randomizing visuals shown to users and refining prediction models. This process of cycling between exploration and exploitation is known as the multiarmed bandit problem and is useful in allocating finite resources to maximize operating performance. Multiarmed bandit problems are important for the deployment of AI in operating models.

Multiarmed bandit algorithms are used to manage trade-offs between exploration and exploitation in various operating workflows, from product recommendations to clinical trials. Reinforcement learning, which uses software agents to interact with an environment and maximize a reward, has gained attention through the success of AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero in beating master players at the game of Go. The Chinese government has made achieving world-class leadership in AI a national priority in response to these advancements.



 Google's DeepMind team has applied lessons from the game Go to drug discovery and protein folding, achieving better performance than scientists. 

 Digital operating models require a state-of-the-art experimentation platform to handle the scale and impact of experimentation. 

 Hypotheses for significant changes must be formalized and tested through randomized control trials to determine their impact using an experimentation platform. 

 The experimentation platform is a necessary component of the AI factory, ensuring any prediction generated by algorithms has a causal effect on the outcome.



 A/B testing through experimentation platforms can gather statistically significant evidence on the impact of specific offers and potential business improvements. 

 Netflix uses an extensive experimentation platform integrated with its algorithm development and execution process to improve various aspects of its service. 

 Netflix embraces experimentation as an integral component of its decision making, allowing employees to run experiments at scale. 

 The data pipeline, algorithm design and execution engine, and experimentation platform should be embedded in software infrastructure to drive the operating activities of a digital firm.

A data platform with a publish-subscribe methodology for APIs provides clean, consistent data to AI applications, allowing agile development teams to build new applications quickly. Strategic investments in connectivity and infrastructure are needed to integrate with the data platform and avoid siloed structures. Clear interfaces are critical for modularity in both code and organization, allowing for decentralized innovation at the module level. The goal is to build thousands of AI applications to make various predictions.

Well-designed APIs enable independent agile teams or individual developers to focus on specific tasks without destroying the consistency of the whole, which is important for building a consistent and secure data platform, especially when sharing data with external partners. APIs allow the required range of functionality for a diverse ecosystem of software vendors. Building a state-of-the-art AI factory with a well-designed data platform improves the organization's ability to focus on the crucial challenges of data governance and security, providing all stakeholders with the necessary protection.



Clear and secure APIs are essential for an AI factory to control data and functionality access.

APIs force a company to define which critical assets it wants to make available within and outside the organization.

Secure, robust, and scalable computational infrastructure on the cloud with standard off-the-shelf components and open source software is necessary.

The infrastructure must be connected to the core digital processes that create value.

Building an AI factory is not limited to large companies, as demonstrated by the Laboratory of Innovation Science at Harvard's collaboration on developing an AI system to map the shape of lung cancer tumors.



An AI system was developed by leveraging the LISH AI factory to automate the task of outlining lung cancer tumors based on CT image scans.

The system was deployed in ten weeks and is as good as a Harvard-trained radiation oncologist.

The LISH AI factory is a data pipeline and platform architecture for solving a variety of problems, often through crowdsourced algorithm design contests.

The system was developed through three sequential contests over ten weeks with thirty-four contestants submitting forty-five algorithms.

The top five contestants used various approaches, including convolutional neural networks and random forest algorithms, despite having no prior experience with medical imaging or cancer diagnostics.



The text describes the use of open-source algorithms for object detection and localization, which performed faster than human experts and commercial software in a cancer analysis contest. 

The example demonstrates that an AI factory can be constructed using available resources and can provide valuable benefits. 

The authors acknowledge that implementing AI in larger, complex organizations requires thoughtful consideration of the firm's operating architecture. 

The next chapter will discuss the strategic implications of re-architecting a firm to accommodate AI technology.



Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos mandated that inter-process communication be restricted to service interface calls over the network and that all service interfaces must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. 

This email from 2002 was in response to the breakdown of the company's processes due to the software infrastructure not being able to support Amazon's growth. 

The Bezos memo is considered a seminal document in the digital transformation of business, emphasizing the need for firms to be built on fundamentally different business and operating foundations. 

Digital firms must be architected differently, resting on an integrated, highly modular digital foundation rather than specialized and siloed organizational processes.

Information technology has become the operating core of firms, with software, data, and AI generating increasing returns to scale, scope, and learning. Jeff Bezos understood that a digital firm requires a different operating model to transform its architecture and leverage its strengths. The relationship between the structure of an organization and the architecture of its technological systems is important for the evolution of firms. Melvin Conway noted in 1967 that the design of systems reflects the communication patterns prevalent in the organization.

Conway's law suggests that the design of integrated technology components reflects communication patterns prevalent in the organization. The mirroring hypothesis states that organizational ties correspond to the technical patterns of dependency in the work being performed. The architecture of systems mirrors the architecture of organizations, becoming a significant asset that enhances quality and efficiency. Productive ways of performing work are embedded in technology, processes, and routines, which can both improve performance and constrain an organization's ability to respond to change. Architectural innovations, which require changing the architecture between technological components, can create new opportunities and challenges for organizations.

The concept of architectural inertia, or resistance to adaptation, can explain the failure of established firms to respond to disruptive change, as they become entrenched in routines and systems. This has been particularly prevalent in enterprise information technology, which has been deployed along traditional boundaries, limiting its systemic impact and potential for learning. Jeff Bezos sought to break this inertia and transform both the technology and organization of Amazon.

Traditional operating architectures of firms evolved from specialized, autonomous functions and units dating back to the Italian Renaissance, which broke down organizations into smaller units for flexibility and to minimize communication load. One of the earliest known examples of distributed commercial operating architecture was in Prato, Italy, where the wool and textile trades were distributed across specialized facilities. These primitive organizations evolved a highly effective operating model and developed leading positions in Europe. The first modern corporation was the Dutch East India Company, founded in 1602, which achieved economies of scale by integrating various shipping portfolios and managing risk. Amazon seeks to build a new model, based on software, data, and AI to transform its operating architecture.

The company grew into a multinational economic powerhouse by subdividing into specialized, largely autonomous units, using a siloed operating architecture and flexible managerial approaches. They monopolized global trade, deploying almost 200 ships and over 50,000 employees. The Industrial Revolution transformed production techniques, leading to the emergence of mass production, specialization, and standardization, resulting in increased advantage of scale and speed of learning.

The Ford Motor Company transformed manufacturing with the introduction of the first moving assembly line, cutting assembly time by a factor of 10 and reducing costs, leading to unprecedented levels of standardization and specialization. The Model T became the first automobile within reach of most American consumers, and by 1918, half of all cars in America were Model Ts. Ford's operating model broke down functional specialties and associated organizational silos to the smallest, most specialized, standardized human tasks, leading the automotive industry for decades.



 General Motors (GM) gained market share from Ford by offering a wider range of cars and creating product-specific organizational units. However, GM's dominance was challenged by competitors, including Toyota, which introduced a more efficient operating model based on learning and problem solving. Mass production in the 20th century led to increasing economies of scale and specialization in manufacturing and service industries, resulting in the decline of traditional crafts.



 Mass production concepts such as specialization and standardization have spread to service industries like supermarkets, fast food franchises, hotels, banks, energy companies, insurance providers, hospitals, and airlines. Specialized, siloed operating models remain essential in manufacturing and service delivery, enabled by information technology but still driven by standard, repeatable work. Adoption of enterprise IT did not transform the trajectory of operating models, as IT systems generally mirrored firms' siloed and specialized structures. The iPhone is assembled in highly specialized, standardized facilities in China.

The structure of many companies remains siloed, with IT and data gathered in a distributed and inconsistent fashion, leading to challenges in integrating data across functional silos. Traditional operating models have limits and can constrain firm growth and value, as seen in the challenges faced by Ford, General Motors, and Toyota.

As traditional organizations grow, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, scope, and learning, leading to bureaucracy and inefficiencies. Information technology has not significantly loosened these constraints. Firms are shaped and limited by their operating models, which help manage complexity but also impose overall limits to growth. A traditional organization's ability to deliver value faces a curve of diminishing returns.

The traditional functional structures and operating silos have constrained the value that can be delivered by the traditional firm, causing firms to hit limits and diminishing returns to scale, scope, and learning. Amazon needed a major architectural change and re-architected its tasks, starting with software, to build the best software and data-driven operating model to expand its retail operations to unprecedented levels of scale, scope, and learning. To achieve this, Amazon broke organizational and technological silos, and the progress of the transformation is shown in Figure 4-3.

Bezos rebuilt Amazon's retail operation on top of a software platform and simultaneously transformed the organization according to the new architectural boundaries. The transformation produced as many challenges as successes, and Brian Valentine was brought in to rebuild Amazon's IT infrastructure. Valentine created a real software platform with a central, standardized set of services and clear APIs for interacting with those services. This shift required Amazon to rewrite virtually all of its e-commerce services, and the new platform took longer to build and implement than originally expected. With the redesign of its retail platform, Amazon's development organization evolved into a modular, distributed structure.

Amazon's structure enables small, independent teams to work while following clear architectural rules, sharing common code and data for machine learning and AI. The company's success in deploying AI is due to its cloud services division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which democratizes access to information services and offers Amazon-developed systems and tools like SageMaker. AWS customers, including large organizations like NASA and Pinterest, are able to deploy AI tools on their own problems and make advances. Amazon's internal machine learning conference has grown from hundreds to thousands of attendees due to the broad scope of the AI reinvention.

A generation of AI-driven firms, including Amazon, is designed with an operating model that drives scale, scope, and learning by aggregating software, data, and analytics, posing an existential threat to traditional firms. These firms depart radically from traditional corporate evolution and have a profoundly different architecture. Digital systems can communicate at zero marginal cost and connect to complementary activities of other agents, providing a limitless set of potential combinations. As long as digital systems use a well-designed, common interface, they can connect and combine capabilities, dramatically enriching the range of possibilities.

Digital operating architectures are designed for unlimited connectivity and data aggregation, enabling powerful analytics. Organizations should create a foundation/platform encompassing data and technology that can be easily and rapidly deployed to create or connect to new digital agents in the form of applications. This foundation should have a common set of data inputs, software technology, and algorithms provided by an AI factory. The applications connect the foundation to enable operating tasks, and the process used to develop these applications is driven by small, agile teams with data science, engineering, and product management capabilities. Modern operating models are also characterized by a focus on improving performance through learning, which happens through real-time fine-tuning of algorithms and on dedicated experimentation platforms using A/B testing.

Digital operating models use data and experimentation to prompt action by consumers, increase satisfaction, and generate revenue. They promote modularity and reuse of software and algorithms, often from open sources, with a focus on accumulating proprietary data. Employees design and oversee a software-automated, algorithm-driven digital organization, removing traditional bottlenecks to scale and making operational complexity easier to manage. Algorithm-driven operating models are almost infinitely scalable with added computing and storage capacity.

Digitized processes in a digital operating model are modular and can easily connect to external networks, increasing their scope and adding value. AI and machine learning thrive on data and can generate increasing returns to scale, turbocharging the way a business delivers value. In this new model, management's role shifts from supervision to design, innovation, and integration of digital systems that sense and respond to customer needs.

Digital, AI-centered operating models challenge traditional managerial and operational assumptions, requiring firms to fundamentally rethink their nature and management teams. Organizational transformation is required to fully realize the business potential of data-centric operating architectures driving AI-powered firms. Microsoft's Satya Nadella balanced conviction with patience in making a big bet on Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform, and this chapter explores what it takes for a company to become an AI company.

Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, transformed the company into a cloud software company with the success of Azure and Office 365. He then announced plans for the next transformation, focusing on the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, and emphasized the responsibility to ensure the benefits of technology are available to everyone and are trusted. Microsoft's stock price tripled in value during his first three years as CEO.

Microsoft underwent a second major operating model transformation, becoming a software-based, AI-driven company. This is a necessary transformation for traditional firms to become accustomed to ongoing change. The chapter focuses on Microsoft's efforts to transform and summarizes five principles drawn from observations about Microsoft and research on hundreds of other companies. The chapter also benchmarks the transformation process and broadens conclusions on the impact of transformation across firms.

Microsoft lost its developer focus and technical edge, leading to a decline in its platform status, as developers moved to open-source alternatives. Under CEO Satya Nadella, the company sought to renew its sense of purpose and identity by going back to its roots as a technology company. Nadella aimed to re-establish Microsoft's ecosystem of developers, and its position as the platform of choice, by focusing on software, data, and AI.

Microsoft's new mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Its strategy involves becoming the productivity platform for the age of AI, with a services-based consumption orientation backed by a cloud-based architecture, increasingly enabled by AI capabilities. To achieve this, Microsoft embraced open source and invested heavily in open source projects, culminating in the acquisition of GitHub in 2018. This strategy has helped Microsoft regain traction with the open source community and become a leading cloud provider.

Microsoft underwent significant transitions in bringing Nadella's strategy to life, which led to an exodus of experienced leaders. However, the remaining team developed a laser focus on the new strategy, particularly in cloud and AI. Microsoft invested heavily in infrastructure, requiring a major transition in the management team and the deployment of an efficient and responsive supply chain. After years of significant investment, Microsoft's operational capabilities have improved, and their investments are paying off.

Cloud-based architectures offer operational benefits, including improved customer alignment and opportunities for analytics. Microsoft tracks customer product usage to inform product improvements and integrate data into increasingly sophisticated platforms. In the consumption business, the responsibility is high as customers rely on mission-critical systems. Before Nadella's promotion, Azure had been run as a separate organization causing challenges for Microsoft. The Azure team often fought with the rest of the server and tools group as they continued to build incompatible software.

Satya Nadella, after becoming the CEO of Microsoft, brought the Azure team under an experienced executive, Bill Laing, to transform the company's core. Azure was redesigned to be more user-friendly, easier to use and compatible with traditional Microsoft products. Scott Guthrie succeeded Laing in running the Azure business and made it increasingly powerful, business-friendly, and compatible with other Microsoft products by transforming the organization's structure and processes. The focus was on making it easier for Microsoft's traditional customers to use the platform.

To transform the company's core, Scott Guthrie restructured the Azure organization's product teams around cohesive, business-focused goals and adopted agile methods. The engineering organization had to dramatically improve its level of responsiveness to operations. Nadella consolidated the company's engineering efforts into two main groups, with Guthrie leading the Cloud and AI group, and Rajesh Jha leading the Experiences and Devices group, and announced the transition to embrace AI at the core of Microsoft. Microsoft had been focused on building a strong AI capability since the early 2000s, and the Nadella announcement accelerated AI technology development and product introductions.

Microsoft's AI strategy revolves around its developer ecosystem, with Azure infrastructure offering AI-driven services like search, knowledge, vision, language, and speech APIs. The company's AI transformation required internal reshaping, led by Kurt DelBene who oversaw the transformation of Microsoft's data assets, internal IT, and operations teams. Nadella chose someone with extensive product experience to run IT and help build Microsoft's own AI factory. A lot had to change, as traditionally, Microsoft IT had run in reactive mode.

To build and deploy the software foundations of a fundamentally different operating model, IT at Microsoft had to transform, led by Kurt DelBene. He changed the name of the organization, reduced its reliance on outsourced development and contractors, and brought in handpicked leads from the product functions to help shape the new orientation and build capability. They hired many more engineers from the product groups to replace contractors and build the new development culture. DelBene's vision was to run IT like a product development team and be agile-based, leveraging AI to preempt things from bad contracts to cyber breaches. The organization can now build AI and ML models on top of everything and search across the entirety of its data sets for analysis.

Microsoft's Core Services engineering organization is a horizontal platform that provides components for the company's processes, helping to rebuild traditional silos on a common digital foundation. The organization partners with internal product teams to inject deep expertise gained by running Microsoft's enterprise back into its own products. Microsoft has also confronted the broader implications of AI, and its transformation efforts provide an operating model foundation that can be deployed across its customer base. Brad Smith was promoted to be Microsoft's new president with explicit responsibilities to run Microsoft's corporate, external, and legal governance.

Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, collaborates with the company's research team to set policies governing Microsoft's use of AI and tackle fundamental issues of privacy, security, accessibility, sustainability, and digital inclusion. Collaboration between CELA and the research team is shaping new policies across the organization, especially when it comes to AI interactions with users and customers. Microsoft has identified six AI principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. These policies are making a difference on the organization, and CELA team members are integrated into a variety of activities, from development to sales.

The article discusses the importance of transforming a company's operating model and building sophisticated data platforms and AI capabilities for effective digital transformation. It highlights five guiding principles for an effective transformation process, including developing strategic clarity and commitment, aligning the organization, building an integrated foundation, creating a culture of continuous learning and improvement, and focusing on customer value. The article emphasizes the importance of sustained leadership commitment and constant reinforcement to drive alignment across the organization for successful transformation.

The success of a company's transformation through analytics and AI requires coordination and collaboration across functions, and the elimination of organizational silos. Clarity in technical goals and centralization of data assets are necessary for consistency and security. Standard policies, components, and architecture are important for deploying sophisticated AI, and can lead to exciting opportunities for business model innovation.

Traditional IT organizations are often resistant to transformation efforts because they were designed to operate a complex IT back office, and their charters did not include innovation and transformation. Developing a product-focused mentality is essential to an AI-centered operating model, and agile methods go hand in hand with a transformed, data-centric operating architecture. Building an AI-centric operating model involves embedding many traditional processes in software and algorithms. The AI-centric firm, with its vast variety of AI-driven processes, is the actual product of a modern, transformed, core services organization.

To transform an organization to an AI-centered operating model, a major cultural shift is required, including developing a software culture and mindset. Building a deep foundation of capability in software, data sciences, and advanced analytics is crucial, and organizations may need to hire a different kind of person and build an appropriate career path and incentive system. Hiring and grooming a data and analytics product manager is also important to identify use cases and lead teams in developing new applications. This may signal the emergence of a new generation of business leadership.

The article discusses the need for leaders who are knowledgeable about AI's impact on society and emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary governance to address the challenges and unintended consequences of AI. It also highlights the need for collaboration across functions, including legal and corporate affairs, and engagement with external partners and communities. Finally, the article notes that many firms are undergoing digital transformation and investing in analytics and AI capabilities.

The article discusses a systematic study of over 350 enterprises' data, analytics, and AI capabilities and their correlation to business performance, leading to an AI maturity index. The research found that firms with higher AI maturity levels had better business performance and were more sophisticated in their use of integrated data platforms and AI for operational automation and business insights. The article highlights the benefits of an AI-enabled operating model.

Leaders benefited from their data and analytics investments in various business functions, including automating decisions and making complex decisions. Top organizations consolidated data to develop a single version of the truth about their business and used business intelligence tools to develop tailored customer experiences and optimize operations. They also used data to understand the market, acquire new customers, and optimize advertising effectiveness. The best firms used data and analytics across engineering, manufacturing, and operations, including consolidating information across the product development life cycle and supply chain. They also used internet of things technologies to optimize manufacturing and service operations.

Best-performing companies invest heavily in developing data, analytics, and AI-centered capabilities, accompanied by a substantial cultural shift. A natural sequence of stages in the journey to become a state-of-the-art AI factory is from siloed data, to pilots, to data hubs, to AI factory. These changes improve business performance, responsiveness, and the customer experience. The financial impact of investments in AI capability shows that leaders outperform laggards in gross margin, earnings before taxes, and net income.

The four stages of digital operating model transformation involve aggregating data from various sources, adopting a clear single source of truth, creating a centralized organization devoted to data sciences and analytics, developing a standard operating model for AI, and building AI skills and capabilities across the organization. This requires substantial investment, architectural shifts, and intense capability-building activities, including clear policies and governance dealing with issues from privacy to bias. However, this transformation is an ongoing journey that shapes the critical path to the customer and society. Organizational resistance is often observed during this process.

Fidelity Investments integrated AI into its business operations, starting with the establishment of an AI Center of Excellence in 2011 led by Vipin Mayar. The company recognized the need to anticipate future needs and prioritize its AI strategy, resulting in the hiring of top data scientists and the emergence of data- and AI-focused product management. This led to the expansion of the company's data and algorithm factory and the building of AI as a core capability for Fidelity. Fidelity's CEO, Abby Johnson, was a strong advocate for this initiative.



 Fidelity implemented an integrated data strategy by centralizing strategic analytics data assets, assembling a 360-degree view of the customer, and developing its own analytics software stack. 

 Fidelity's data platform tracked and integrated over 36 million user profiles and interactions to provide customer insights and improve services, resulting in a more integrated end-to-end experience for clients. 

 Organizational and cultural shifts towards agile methods allowed Fidelity to break down traditional silos and work together on agile teams to rapidly deploy new applications. 

 Fidelity launched a comprehensive education effort to drive AI capability across the firm. 

 Fidelity set three priorities for its AI efforts, including customer experience, investing in highly personalized investment strategies, and improving operations through automation.



 Fidelity's investments will focus on revenue growth, optimizing operating processes, scalability, and generating business insights through AI. 

 Fidelity is driving a data- and AI-centric operating model across its multiple lines of business to improve performance and deliver exceptional customer experience. 

 Explicit investments in governance are being made to drive cross-functional policies around AI usage, impact, cybersecurity, and privacy. 

 Many firms are engaged in operating model transformation, driving new capabilities and powering new business opportunities. 

 As digital transformation reshapes the economy, firms need a new way to approach strategy to shape their business models.

The article discusses the impact of digital transformation on business networks and the need for a new lens for evaluating options. The emergence of keystone firms with greater connectivity and data analytics has transformed the economy into an AI-powered network of subnetworks. The article highlights the importance of strategy and business model transformation in this new age of network effects.

The article emphasizes the importance of digital connections between network nodes and data analytics in shaping and controlling networks, which are becoming increasingly important to the economy and social system. Competitive advantage is defined by the ability to connect businesses, aggregate data, and extract value through analytics and AI. As conventional strategies become ineffective, strategic analysis should focus on the structure and importance of the connections a firm creates across industries and on the flows of data through the networks it connects to. The article suggests that network analysis will increasingly shape strategic thinking in the future.

The text offers guidance on conducting network analysis in business strategy and uses the research of Feng Zhu as a reference. The chapter examines the critical interactions between a business and the rest of the economy, analyzes how each network can shape the dynamics of value creation and capture, and presents an example of an existing business. Network analysis involves understanding the open and distributed connections across firms, which accumulate network and learning effects. The chapter concludes by summarizing the key implications of network analysis for business strategy.

The text explains the value of network and learning effects in business, and how they can amplify the value provided by increasing the number of connections within and across networks. The value created by different businesses is illustrated in figure 6-1, which shows the typical diminishing returns to scale for traditional businesses and the increasing returns for businesses with stronger network and learning effects. The general idea in strategic network analysis is to find ways to increase the value created at scale and to capture the value created effectively. The text also provides an example from the healthcare sector.



Network analysis involves mapping economic networks and examining data flows for AI advantage. 

Example of a pharmaceutical company using an app to manage Parkinson's disease, which could benefit related service providers. 

Strategic analysis should consider all potential network interactions and synergies with core business. 

Data captured on one network can create value across multiple other networks.



Using an app to manage Parkinson's disease can improve drug efficacy, deepen consumer loyalty, and gather useful data for complementary applications. 

Patient-to-patient interaction can foster relationships and sharing of innovative approaches. 

Connecting with insurers, physicians, and health providers can establish support and amplify data-driven insights for better treatment. 

Analyzing each network separately is important to understand different properties, learning opportunities, willingness to pay, and competition. 

Network structure impacts business model dynamics of value creation and capture, with interactions and synergies across networks important to consider.

The digital operating model's network effects are the most crucial value creation dynamic, which means that the product or service's value increases with the number of users. The value increase of a network is dependent on context and subject to debate, with different models suggesting different value curves. Unlike traditional products, network effects increase a network's intrinsic utility as it adds users.

The underlying value of a traditional product is fixed and does not increase with the number of users, unlike a digital operating model's network effects. Network effects increase a network's intrinsic utility as it adds users, and the more network connections, the greater the value. There are two main types of network effects: direct, where users value the presence of other users, and indirect, where users in one category value the presence of users in another category. Examples of networks that exhibit indirect network effects are Uber, Airbnb, YouTube, and gaming console platforms.

One-sided network effects can occur when only one side values the presence of the other. Companies can leverage one type of network effect to generate the other type. The relationship between network scale and value is complex and the extent to which networks can increase in value as they grow differs widely. Starting businesses that rely on weak network effects is easier, but any advantage gained in the short term is less sustainable in the long term. Premium content streaming businesses like Netflix can reach value quickly.

Netflix's network effects weaken over time as competitors can follow the same path without much disadvantage. YouTube has stronger network effects as independent content producers have little incentive to post on any other site. Businesses with strong network effects have fewer competitors and increased market concentration. Learning effects add value to existing network effects or generate value in their own right. Google's search business benefits from learning effects as more searches conducted by users improve the service. Microsoft's Bing failed to compete with Google's search advertising business because it didn't benefit from the same learning effects.

Learning effects reinforced by scale can amplify the impact of a firm's operating model and capabilities, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The accuracy of most algorithms rises with the square root of the number of data points, but levels off as the algorithm is fully trained. The type and uniqueness of data required, as well as the algorithms in use, also impact competitive advantage. The more data used to train and optimize an algorithm, the more accurate its output, and the bigger the user base, the greater the value.

The type and uniqueness of data required to train an algorithm impact a business's competitive advantage. Algorithms that require more unique data, such as those involved in autonomous car technology, create more barriers to entry for competitors. Learning and network effects work together, with larger networks providing more valuable connections, data, and opportunities for AI. The structure of a network also affects its sustainability, with clustered networks like Uber's being more sustainable than global networks like Airbnb's.

Creating global brand awareness is essential to build a liquid marketplace for home-sharing, but entry carries a high price due to barriers to competition. Global networks are more concentrated around critical hubs, making sustaining profitability easy for the dominant player. Marriott's entry into the home-sharing market will provide insight into how well incumbents can execute a network-effects strategy. In contrast, Uber's network is highly clustered, making it easier for challengers to enter. Clustered networks are typically highly competitive, and any competitor with local scale can achieve similar efficiencies.

Uber faces local competition from companies like Gett, Juno, and Via in major cities like New York. Clustering applies to various industries, including group buying sites, food delivery platforms, medical networks, and sports networks, and makes firms vulnerable to competition. Global hubs do not emerge in clustered networks. The strength and structure of network and learning effects can change over time, making markets more or less competitive.

During the late 1990s, Windows had a dominant platform due to six million dedicated developers writing applications exclusively for it. However, as internet usage exploded, web-based and mobile applications became more popular and cross-compatible across different operating systems. This decreased the strength of Windows' network effect and allowed for more options for value capture. Digital value capture technologies, such as usage metering and sophisticated pricing algorithms, can help businesses optimize the value captured.

Sophisticated pricing approaches can help capture value on digital business networks, but not all value can be captured. The appropriability of value depends on factors such as the existence of competition and customers' willingness to pay. Network effects open new types of value capture options, such as charging customers for access to the network. Companies with two-sided indirect network effects have more options for value capture by charging each side separately based on their willingness to pay. Multihoming, or using multiple platforms simultaneously, is becoming more common and can increase competition and reduce the ability to capture value on a single platform.



Multihoming, the ability for users or service providers to form ties with multiple platforms, challenges the value capture of network hubs facing competition from other hubs connecting to a network in a similar way. 

The more or the fiercer the competition, the lower the value captured by a network hub. 

Multihoming is common on the developer side of the smartphone app market, making it hard for platforms to make money on that side, but the vast majority of consumers single-home to either iOS or Android phones, enabling significant profits for Apple and Android from the consumer side. 

In the ride-hailing and home-sharing industries, multihoming is common on both sides of the platform, leading to constant undercutting and challenges for platforms to generate profits from their businesses.



Multihoming hinders profitability in ride- and home-sharing services, and platform owners try to reduce it by attempting to lock in one side of the market. 

Uber and Lyft use rate discounts, rewards programs, and other incentives to encourage drivers to become exclusive, but multihoming is still common. 

Airbnb offers exclusive tools to power users to increase switching costs, but profitability is still limited. 

Video game console makers use exclusive contracts with publishers and high prices to reduce player incentives to multihome, while Amazon uses fulfillment services and Amazon Prime to incentivize third-party sellers to sell exclusively on its platform.

The article discusses the problem of disintermediation, which occurs when users bypass a hub or middleman in a network after the initial connection is made. This is especially common in marketplaces like Homejoy and TaskRabbit, which only provide a connection between network participants. Hubs have used various mechanisms to deter disintermediation, but they are not always effective. One way to discourage disintermediation is to enhance the value for users of conducting business through the hub, such as providing insurance, payment escrow, communication tools, and dispute resolution.

The article discusses how trust and disintermediation impact network-based profitability. Improving the accuracy of a reputation system to foster trust between clients and freelancers may lead to more disintermediation, reducing revenue gains. To reduce disintermediation, platforms can offer complementary services instead of relying on transaction fees. Network bridging can improve a firm's business model by making connections between different networks, enabling value creation and capturing.

Connecting previously separate economic networks can create new synergies and improve the ability to create and capture value. Companies can leverage data-based assets across multiple network sides to succeed in different markets. Hub firms like Amazon and Alibaba use payment networks to bridge e-commerce platforms with financial services, allowing them to issue short-term loans to consumers and merchants with very low default rates. These networks mutually reinforce each other's market position and help capture value on new and different networks.

Successful network hubs sustain each other's scale and drive connections across previously disconnected industries. Strategic network analysis involves listing the major networks a business is connected to and evaluating their potential for value creation and capture at scale. Uber is an example of a business with multiple networks, including riders, drivers, food providers, and health-care providers, and it partners with different organizations to increase value creation and capture opportunities. The number of networks will likely grow as the business searches for additional opportunities.

The article provides a checklist of network properties that can affect value creation and capture in Uber's business model. Uber's main businesses do not have direct network effects, but they benefit from learning effects and data analysis. However, the geographical clustering of Uber's networks weakens network effects, and the company faces competition from local services in different locations, which challenges its profitability.

The article discusses the challenges faced by Uber's business model due to weak network effects, extensive multihoming, and geographical clustering. The profitability of Uber's core business is not assured, and sustained profitability will depend on its ability to bridge its drivers and riders into additional networks for value creation and capture. However, there are opportunities for Uber to create value and capture profits by leveraging its intrinsic value and connecting to additional networks.

Uber's strategy involves bridging opportunities to connect its driver network with other business networks such as grocery delivery, Uber Eats, and Uber Health. These opportunities may or may not be profitable depending on the deals that Uber can make with providers. Uber Eats and UberPool present additional opportunities but also face competition and local clustering challenges. UberPool, however, adds direct network effects to Uber's traditional indirect network effects business, making it less likely for competitors to provide a similar service.

Uber's UberPool and Cargo Systems present additional opportunities for profitability and bridging potential, but face challenges in achieving scale and profitability. Cargo offers a way to sell products to riders while they are captive in a ride-sharing vehicle, potentially increasing profits for drivers and Uber. Entrepreneurs and executives should ask about their core value proposition and potential value creation and capture opportunities when developing strategies and connecting to networks.

The Parkinson's app relies on its patient network for gathering useful data to monitor the progress of the disease, and its learning effects are strong. However, it will take many deployments before the data is truly useful, and the app should consider adding functionality to promote additional significant network effects for sustaining its competitive advantage. Direct network effects like mutual support, coaching, and advice could help further sustain the app.

For a company relying on strong network and learning effects, it is important to bootstrap its business until it reaches critical mass. Tactics such as loading the app with content, providing treatment advice and best practices, and gamifying the experience can help kick-start growth. In addition, secondary networks such as physicians, researchers, insurers, and pharmacies are of interest and can add substantial indirect network effects to the app. The Parkinson's app could build functionality to help physicians provide coaching and advice to patients, which would improve its competitive position and business sustainability.



 The Parkinson's app business is clustered on Parkinson's patients, limiting its scale, but plugging into related networks can deliver daily value with high engagement and unlikely disintermediation and multihoming. 

 Significant value can be created at scale for patients, physicians, researchers, and insurers, but critical mass is required due to strong learning and network effects. 

 Charging patients or physicians is not recommended, but monetization opportunities include increased branding and exposure to complementary pharmaceutical business, targeted ads, physician referrals, insurance subsidies, and anonymized data monetization. 

 Overall, the Parkinson's app business has good potential to add value to the treatment and management of Parkinson's disease.



 Parkinson's app business could bridge to other disease networks through insurers, physicians, and health-care providers for additional value creation opportunities. 

 Chapter 6 explored how digitizing a firm's operating model can open new strategic options and transform value creation and capture. 

 Chapter 7 examines the broader competitive implications of collisions between firms with digital operating models and more traditional firms, which can completely transform industries and reshape their nature.

Digital operating models may take time to generate economic value compared to traditional models, but once they scale beyond critical mass, they can deliver impressive value and overwhelm traditional firms. The collision between digital and traditional firms can be seen in the global travel industry, where Airbnb's lean and agile organization built on an integrated data platform accumulates network and learning effects, rapidly driving scale, scope, and learning, while Marriott's growth and responsiveness are limited by its traditional operational constraints. In barely a decade, Airbnb has scaled to offer a large inventory of rooms, three times as much as traditional hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton.

Airbnb's lean and agile organization accumulates network and learning effects, rapidly driving scale, scope, and learning by constantly mining its data, using AI and machine learning to provide new insights, and expanding in scope to offer a broad variety of experiences. Booking Holdings is another formidable force in the global travel market, offering 30 million listings in more than 150,000 destinations built over a slightly longer time than Airbnb. Both Airbnb and Booking are architected to enable a software- and data-centric operating model, increasing scale, scope, and learning without traditional operational constraints. The industry is transforming, with market concentration increasing and M&A activity on a high boil. Marriott has responded by merging with Starwood to exploit synergies across loyalty programs and related data assets.

Marriott is working to remain competitive against digital travel companies like Airbnb and Booking, who have digitized critical tasks and built systems to satisfy traveler needs without relying on traditional organizations. Airbnb and Booking have added a software layer to the travel industry and leverage network and learning effects to amplify value. They accumulate data on user behavior to improve operational decisions.

Data is used by algorithms to prioritize content and engage users, amplifying network and learning effects. As the operating model develops more connections and accumulates data, the services provided improve and attract more users, further increasing data and network effects. This creates self-reinforcing loops that make a big difference in competition. Traditional operating models allow for competition, but as network and learning effects drive more value, traditional constraints disappear, and the value delivered increases at an increasing rate.

The dominance of digital operating systems in the travel industry is leading to concentration and making it difficult for traditional companies to compete. The profits of hotel companies are shifting towards the operating system layer, leading to an epic battle for control of the global travel market. The example of Nokia's collapse shows how a company can go from industry leadership to irrelevance due to changing market dynamics.

Nokia was a quintessential product company with a focus on the user, high-quality manufacturing processes, and integrated hardware and software features. However, its product strategy sacrificed digital consistency, with multiple operating systems and software designs. This led to headaches for developers and the failure of its app store.

Nokia's product-focused approach did not allow for scale, scope or learning benefits from a consistent digital foundation, whereas Apple's iOS and Google's Android were built on a single digital platform, attracting third-party app developers and service providers. This resulted in large networks of app developers, intense developer excitement, higher levels of user engagement and increased value for iOS and Android.

The introduction of iPhone and Android smartphones disrupted the traditional product-based business models of competitors such as Nokia, BlackBerry, Sony Ericsson, and Motorola, leading to a shift in industry profits from hardware to software. Despite investing in R&D, Nokia failed to compete with the value generated by the app developer and advertiser networks on iOS and Android. The market tipped and Nokia had two options: build its own digital operating model or compete head-on with Android and iOS.

The article discusses Nokia's downfall due to its failure to adapt to the smartphone market, where it did not standardize its digital framework or become a complement to new software-based entrants. Instead, Nokia attempted to build more products within its existing operating architecture and committed to the Windows mobile operating system. The article highlights how Samsung survived by focusing on hardware features and components while becoming a strategic supplier of high-quality screen displays. The article suggests that the smartphone story is threatening to repeat everywhere, with examples such as Airbnb and Booking challenging Marriott and Hilton, and cloud computing services replacing traditional IT departments.

The article discusses how traditional firms are colliding with data-driven, software-centric operating models, leading to transformations across various industries. Examples include Alibaba and Amazon replacing traditional retailers, OTT video services challenging pay TV providers, and fintech companies competing with traditional banks and insurance companies. The computing sector has also seen collisions between operating architectures, with the establishment of Windows as the OS of choice for the industry due to its large and powerful ecosystem. The article highlights the profound transformation that these collisions bring, changing competitive dynamics and market structure.

The dominance of Windows in PC operating systems, generated by strong network effects, lasted for over a decade. Google's increasing dominance in smartphones resembles the Windows playbook, with added data, AI, and advertising services. Cloud computing has digitized software distribution, with consumption-based pricing and network-based access to computing services. Microsoft has made significant progress in offering cloud services optimized for business applications, and Amazon and Microsoft alternate as the world's most valuable company in this industry. The shift to cloud computing has transformed the business and operating models of software providers.

Firms in the technology industry are better equipped to transform due to their less siloed and fragmented operating architecture. Online retailers started with digitizing buying transactions and moving them online, but Amazon and other platforms rearchitected their operating model to aggregate data and share software components. Traditional retailers were able to compete with the first generation of online retailers, but the threat came from the rearchitected, data-centric, software-based operating model of platforms like Amazon. This transformation required a fundamentally different operating model beyond just moving transactions online.

The retail and entertainment industries have been transformed by the adoption of data- and software-centric operating models. Retail supply chains have become more efficient through software deployment, while traditional industry giants have been taken down by the retail apocalypse. Online retailers that adopted a software- and data-centric approach have thrived. In the entertainment industry, Napster was the first to successfully compete with traditional players, sparking new collisions and transforming music distribution. RealNetworks was the first internet streaming video company, but suffered in competition with other companies due to its business model.

The streaming industry has been transformed by established software providers like Microsoft and Apple, as well as by newcomers like YouTube and Netflix. YouTube dominates its market through network effects and a community of small content providers, while Netflix relies on a more concentrated set of content production studios. Companies like Hulu and Amazon differentiate themselves by accessing unique content through special studio relationships and vertical integration. Digital firms with large content production budgets, like Google, Netflix, Apple, and Amazon, are competing with traditional cable and satellite TV providers using data-centric operating models and personalization.

Traditional media companies are merging with content and internet service providers to transform operations around a digital core. Digital firms may emerge as focused competitors or leverage synergies in assets and capabilities across industries. Cars becoming more connected and digital threaten traditional operating models of automobile companies. Extracting economic value from a moving, connected car requires a data-centric operating model that delivers on-demand services or highly targeted ads. Autonomous driving systems present the best opportunity for this.

As autonomous driving becomes more prevalent, car interiors will become more focused on entertainment and social interaction, creating a new market for relevant local ads. Alphabet, with its Android and Google Maps platforms, is well positioned to capture this value. Auto manufacturers are integrating hub firms' services into their vehicles, and Alphabet subsidiary Waymo is developing a driverless car as a service business that could earn hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. The industry is shifting from car ownership to convenience and services offered by automobiles, with potential effects on insurance, repair and maintenance providers, road and construction companies, law enforcement, infrastructure providers, and government revenue.

As the automotive industry moves towards software and services, traditional manufacturers face eroding revenues and margins. They must either compete with hub firms like Alphabet and Apple or work with them. Some are investing in the emerging software and services layers, experimenting with new business models, and partnering with car-as-service providers. However, they may need to rearchitect their operating models and join forces to aggregate enough scale to compete. HERE, a map and location service provider, is an interesting case study.

HERE, a precision map and location service provider, is an attempt by traditional auto manufacturers to work together to assemble a federated platform and counterbalance threats from Google and Apple. The automotive sector is undergoing major changes and must not underestimate the competitive skill and scale of digital firms. We are witnessing a new generation of digital operating models transforming the economics and nature of service delivery, leading to a more concentrated, winner-take-all world. Different industries are increasingly connected through the new, ubiquitous digital fabric. A generation of hub firms has emerged, including Apple, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Baidu, Facebook, Microsoft, Tencent, and Alibaba.



 Hub firms are centralizing and connecting disparate industries through their operating models, capturing a large share of the value generated and shaping the future. They create and control essential connections in key networks, creating competitive bottlenecks. Digital superpowers, such as Android, Amazon, Alibaba, and Tencent, are driving increasing returns to scale, scope, and learning, and can tip the global competitive balance. As traditional processes are replaced by digital technology, the impact of data, analytics, and AI is ramping up.



 The impact of digital technology is threatening diverse industries, including media, banking, automotive, and travel. Leading firms, such as Marriott and Hilton, are investing in major transformation to integrate disparate data assets and develop capabilities in analytics and AI. The spread of digital operating models is creating a range of new threats, from erosion of consumer privacy to disinformation campaigns and economic disparity. Managers will have to reflect on their evolving role in the digital economy. The ethics of digital scale, scope, and learning are important considerations, particularly in matters of public health and children's health.

In February 2019, Rep. Adam Schiff sent letters to Sundar Pichai of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Jeff Bezos of Amazon about the spread of anti-vaccination propaganda on their platforms. False health information is a global public health concern. Digital platforms have the power to spread and target information but can also be used to weaponize misinformation and stoke bias. The learning algorithms and datasets used by these platforms can be misused and are vulnerable to cyberattacks, threatening consumer privacy. The ethical considerations and issues faced by managers are being transformed by digital operating models. Business leaders need to take into account their responsibilities to various stakeholders.

Digitally enabled businesses raise new ethical challenges for stakeholders, grouped into five main categories: digital amplification, bias, security, control, and inequality. The challenges apply to diverse organizations, and new digital capabilities can be used and misused in unintended ways. Leaders should be aware of these challenges and act to mitigate them. Digital amplification, such as algorithms used to optimize engagement, can be dangerous by reinforcing biases and serving harmful messages to millions of people. The anti-vaccination movement is an example of harmful digital amplification.

The anti-vax movement has been amplified by social networks and ad-targeting technology, leading to an increase in nonmedical vaccination exemptions and outbreaks of dangerous diseases. Echo chambers, created through personalized information and active user engagement, are not limited to the anti-vax movement and are being used for political, social, and religious biases. Digital networks have a larger scale and scope than traditional media, allowing for greater impact of biases even without intentional harm.

Research has found discrimination against people with non-European-sounding names, disabilities, and LGBTQ community members in digital platforms like Airbnb and Kiva. Digital systems can amplify the implicit bias of users, leading to adverse impacts. Algorithmic bias is another ethical challenge in AI-driven decisions, with selection bias occurring when input data does not accurately represent the population or context being analyzed. Amazon's internal HR system is an example of selection bias as it devalued the potential of female job candidates due to the underlying data based primarily on male engineers.

Selection bias and labeling bias can lead to AI systems that discriminate against certain groups, as seen in examples such as a women's chess club captain being downgraded and AI-based facial recognition software having difficulty identifying darker-skinned women. Lack of diversity in training datasets and off-the-shelf, open source datasets can contribute to bias. Labeling or tagging data, which is often crowdsourced, can also lead to bias.

Labeling bias can occur in crowdsourced descriptions of images, as seen in examples such as an image of a woman and man being tagged as a conversation between a woman and her boss. Machine learning models have also been found to associate gender and race with certain occupations or words. Bias can also plague data tagged by specialists, as in medical imaging, where overtreatment bias can lead to labeling bias. Machine learning software can amplify these biases.

Expert-labeled datasets used for training algorithms are biased and imperfect, as labeling is limited by the knowledge and perspective of the person doing it. Algorithms themselves are designed for a purpose, and this introduces a kind of bias. The potential for mistakes is high when algorithms make trade-offs in real-time and steer content to millions of people. Understanding algorithmic bias and working to reduce it is crucial. Managers should carefully choose objectives and datasets to match when selecting models and support countermeasures.

Ethical challenges involved in algorithmic operating models are complex and require careful selection of transparent and appropriate algorithms that represent the problem at hand. Cyberattacks are a growing concern, with AI and massive datasets compounding the problem. Breaches such as the Equifax breach, which exposed sensitive personal data of nearly half of the US population, highlight the dangers of storing large amounts of personal data in one place. The attackers did not specifically target Equifax, but rather exploited a vulnerability they found during a search.

Equifax, a credit reporting agency, was hacked in 2017 through a vulnerability in Apache Struts, allowing hackers to gain access to unencrypted usernames and passwords. The attackers gradually queried more than 50 databases over 76 days without being detected. Equifax delayed announcing the breach for over a month and its executives sold shares worth $2 million during this time. Many other companies have also experienced cybersecurity breaches in the past decade.

There are two kinds of companies: those that know they have been hacked and those that don't. The challenge of protecting customer data is getting tougher as reliance on data continues to rise. Companies must invest in prevention and response mechanisms, as slow response or delayed communication can exacerbate damages for the company and consumers. Cybersecurity is a common challenge and companies must upgrade their IT systems and invest in various technologies and services to prevent and detect cyber threats. Companies have a responsibility to safeguard data, and when a breach is detected, they must respond quickly and communicate effectively.



 Security challenges go beyond traditional cyberattacks and include attacks that hijack digital operating models for rogue purposes. 

 The Christchurch shooting in 2019 is an example of such an attack, where the shooter captured the events on a bodycam and shared them on Facebook Live, leading to widespread distribution of the video and incitement of violence against Muslims. 

 Facebook and YouTube faced challenges in removing the video, with many variants still being distributed through changes to the original video. 

 There is also evidence of Russian-sponsored digital hijacking to influence political campaigns in the US, UK, and elsewhere. 

 The US Department of Justice indicted thirteen Russian citizens and three Russian companies for criminal activities designed to spread bias, sow discord in the US political system, and support the Trump campaign in 2016.



 The Internet Research Agency LLC, suspected of being a front for Russian intelligence, allegedly engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes, employing hundreds of people in online operations including social media advertising, fake accounts, and targeted content. 

 The group was particularly effective in suppressing the African American vote and alienating Bernie Sanders supporters. 

 The scale of the operation reached at least 126 million Facebook users and 2,700 Twitter accounts via 36,000 bots. 

 As digital operating models amplify organizations' capabilities, cybersecurity challenges become increasingly sophisticated and threaten social and political institutions. 

 Many firms are fighting this new generation of criminals, but one weak link can lead to significant problems.

The article discusses the importance of individuals, managers, business and government leaders working together to defend against the perils of harmful incidents in the digital economy. It highlights the gray areas between cyberattacks and the authorized use of customer data by third parties and the need for platform control to ensure tools and technologies do not cause harm. However, the challenge lies in defining the "good" without infringing on free speech and trusting organizations like Facebook to make decisions for the rest of us. The article cites the example of Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook user data.

The article describes how Aleksandr Kogan, with funding from SCL and Cambridge Analytica, harvested Facebook user data through an app and survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, compromising the data of more than 50 million people. Cambridge Analytica used this data to create psychological profiles of potential voters for political campaigns, including those of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. The incident highlights the need for platform control and responsible use of data in the digital economy.

The Facebook platform initially allowed developers to introduce numerous apps and services, including Facebook Connect and Open Graph. However, problems arose when developers were permitted to collect data from users' friends without their consent, which led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook responded by suspending the company's access to the platform and demanding the deletion of the data, but did not conduct an audit, which may have been a mistake.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal highlights the challenges of controlling digital platforms, which rely on openness and connectedness to achieve scale and learning. However, these same qualities also make platforms vulnerable to unintended harm, particularly when they involve the sharing of consumer data. Platform companies must strike a balance between too much and too little control, which is complicated when the platform includes third-party assets like advertising platforms. Closed platforms like Apple's iOS and App Store are more secure, but open platforms like Google Android and Google Play Store are more vulnerable to malicious apps.

Sophisticated ad platforms use data to aid advertisers in finding the right consumers, but there is a line between relevance and privacy violation. Ad platforms may need to decide on the appropriateness of each ad, which raises questions of control and censorship. The issue of private actors governing public action is challenging for executives and company stakeholders. The case of Ant Financial, which collects unprecedented consumer data, poses potential harm in case of a cyber breach. The use of APIs by companies exposes their data and functionality to an ecosystem, which amplifies these challenges.

As digital operating models drive network and learning effects, the asymmetries across organizations will tend to grow, and markets will become more concentrated, prompting concerns about equity. Spotify is preparing for an antitrust battle with Apple over platform control, including Apples 30% fee on every in-app purchase and restrictions on apps downloaded from its App Store. Other firms like Netflix and video game developers have also complained about Apples tax on app providers. Digital operating models create fundamental challenges like network effects, leading to increased market concentration and platform control.

The article discusses the challenges faced by businesses operating on platforms like Google, Apple, and Amazon, where these platforms have control over access to users and may also compete with their complementors. However, the phenomenon is complex, and there are ways in which multihoming and network clustering can work as pushback against dominant behavior. Companies like Walmart's online marketplace and local ride-sharing firms are providing alternatives and competition to these dominant platforms. The article also discusses how Uber and Lyft have worked to reduce multihoming and clustering in their markets.

The article discusses how firms use operational tactics to shape and control economic networks, and the increasing concentration of power in industries due to the deployment of AI-powered and data-centric operating models. Regulators and lawmakers are taking note and insisting on increased scrutiny of digital firms, but simplistic solutions like breaking up businesses are not effective. Instead, there is a need for effective and responsive regulatory frameworks and proactive leadership to address new challenges.

Modern firms must address ethical challenges posed by digital scale, scope, and learning, with practical and implementable technical and business solutions. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook are investing heavily in research and solutions to address algorithmic bias, fake news, and harmful posts. Keystone companies, like Facebook and Equifax, occupy central network positions and are essential to the economy and social system, regulating the health of their business networks and providing services to all network nodes or community members. The responsibility for addressing ethical challenges lies with the organizations that wield the most power.

As network hubs, firms have a responsibility to sustain the health of their business ecosystems and align their objectives with those of their networks through a keystone strategy. This strategy focuses on aligning internal and external needs to benefit the long-term performance of the firm. The concept of information fiduciary proposes that firms like Google and Facebook, as controllers of extensive consumer information, have important responsibilities not to harm the communities they collect information from.

The authors propose a grand bargain in which companies take on fiduciary responsibilities as information fiduciaries in exchange for federal preemption of state and local laws. Hub firms have a responsibility to sustain the digital economy and should pursue actions that enable its long-term sustainability. Some leaders of digital firms already understand this, but more pressure is needed to nudge them into action.

The emergence of a new type of firm, the software-driven firm, that uses AI to break down operational constraints is changing the rules of the economy and society. This new meta is generating significant opportunities but also leaving us struggling to understand its full implications. This kind of fundamental change in the rules has happened before with the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. The next chapter will discuss the broader long-term patterns of digital networks and AI.

The Industrial Revolution brought about a significant transformation in the means of value creation and capture, marked by increased specialization of work, componentization of organizations, and carefully designed production processes. The shift from handcrafted to mass production methods redefined industry boundaries and competitive dynamics, leading to economic, social, and political change. The Luddite movement emerged in response to the replacement of traditional textile production methods with coal-powered automated handlooms and high-volume factories, leading to ethical dilemmas and the obsolescence of traditional capabilities and manufacturing strategies. Workers demanded a fair share of increased factory profits and a new tax on cloth.

The Luddite movement emerged as a response to the deployment of new machinery and the construction of textile factories during the Industrial Revolution, leading to the destruction of machines and property. The Luddites were upset by the concentration of wealth among industrialists and believed it came at the expense of the working class. The movement became increasingly violent, resulting in assassinations and attempts, leading to the British army's intervention, and the execution of Luddites. The movement exemplifies the unrest caused by a new meta-emerging, characterized by increased specialization, enabled by new production technology, and organizational subdivisions that rendered traditional artisanal methods of production obsolete.

The Industrial Revolution brought deep and pervasive transformation to the world economy, leading to an increase in standard of living but also wealth disparity and social tensions. In the age of AI, change is no longer localized but systemic, affecting all industries globally at the same time. The exponential growth of computing power is driving this change, and it is expected to continue with no slowdown in sight. It is important to pay attention to these emerging principles.

Digital technology and AI are transforming all industries at an accelerated pace, with a massive wave of change across the entire economy and society. This creates both opportunities and challenges, as an increasing number of tasks will be enhanced or automated by digital systems. However, this also leads to inevitable dislocation as many traditional tasks are digitized. Studies show that as much as half of current work activities could be replaced by AI or software-enabled systems. The challenge is to recognize and navigate this systemwide transformation.

Machine learning will transform the nature of every job, regardless of income level and specialization, leading to both enriching job opportunities and widespread dislocation across many occupations. The impact of AI will be many times greater and faster than that of the Industrial Revolution, and social dislocation is likely to become increasingly challenging. The adoption of AI is transforming the nature of capabilities in a fundamentally different way, with AI-powered, network-centric capabilities becoming increasingly horizontal and universal in almost every setting.

In the age of AI, universal capabilities such as data sourcing, processing, analytics, and algorithm development are becoming more important for competitive advantage than traditional industry specialization. This is leading to the emergence of a new breed of universal competitors and eroding traditional differentiation strategies and specialization. The characteristics of each market respond more to new drivers like network and learning effects than to traditional industry-specific knowledge and expertise, leading to a shift away from core competencies and towards an age shaped by data and analytics.

The increasing digitization of various industries is leading to a convergence of technologies and the blurring of traditional industry boundaries. Companies are now competing based on their network position, accumulation of differentiated data, and deployment of new analytics, rather than just specialized vertical expertise. Digital interfaces allow for easy entry into new industries with highly connected business models, leading to a recombination of industries. Digital networks enjoy increasing returns, unlike traditional organizations, leading to a shift in the way industries compete. Companies like Amazon, Tencent, and Ant Financial are leveraging their networks and AI to supercharge their businesses across various markets.

The age of AI has led to a convergence of markets and the need for companies to leverage customers and data across sectors. This expansion through recombination creates new value, but can have costs and impact existing actors. Managers need to understand the dynamic of recombination and develop network bridging strategies to leverage their data and relationships. Meanwhile, traditional operating constraints are being removed by digital operating models, leading to a new generation of firms growing to unprecedented levels of global influence.

Digital scale is driving a variety of important processes, influencing operating efficiencies and social/political activities. Frictionless systems can create major problems as they are prone to instability and have difficulty finding equilibrium. Removing friction can cause signals to reach networks with virtually infinite scale and scope, making them almost impossible to stop. This can lead to the spread of phony headlines and inappropriate content, as seen in the case of the Christchurch shooting videos posted on social media platforms.

Frictionless, AI-driven processes can work as powerful amplifiers of information, opinion, bias, and aggression, reaching billions of people with tunable, customizable content. However, this can lead to leadership and governance challenges, and concentration and inequality are likely to get worse as digital networks lead to the concentration of power and value. The evolution of these networks leads to the concentration of the flow of transactions and data, and hub firms such as Google and Facebook gain important advantages as they link consumers, firms, and whole industries.

The digital age has accelerated the transformation of industries and increased the importance of digital hubs. This concentration of power and wealth in network hubs leads to increased inequality across workers and firms, causing frustration and anger in certain segments and geographical regions. The rise of the digital firm amplifies its impact and decreases public trust and cohesion, leading to significant signs of fracture such as the Occupy and Yellow Vest movements. This suggests that economic and social changes driven by the digital age may be as significant as those seen in the Industrial Revolution.

The value of digital innovation is immense, but its relatively unconstrained operating models are amplifying economic disparities, reinforcing extreme political views, and exposing society to attack by rogue actors. As the nature of work is redefined by software and algorithms, and news bias and political manipulation become widespread, vulnerabilities are threatening important institutions. Sensitivities to employees, customers, partners, and the community at large are required to address the resulting social dislocations and redistribution of income, influence, and power, including creative investments and consideration of a universal basic income.

The decisions made by leaders have a significant impact on our society, and Lord Byron's speech suggests that fair examination of grievances could prevent conflicts. The emergence of Luddites coincided with the establishment of modern corporations, and the age of AI is creating new challenges that require wisdom. The current shortage of managerial wisdom may be due to the redefinition of the impact of firms in the age of AI, and the evolving concept of the firm. In chapter 10, the author provides recommendations for leaders to meet these new challenges.

Leaders must find better ways to manage new assets and capabilities in the increasingly digital firm, and this applies to all types of organizations. The leadership mandate is playing out in four arenas, and transformation is a critical area that requires changing the organization, building the right skills and capabilities, and transforming the operating architecture. While the technologies are available for everyone to use, the most difficult work is in implementing digital transformation.

Wisdom requires managerial action for the rapid changes across industries, but developing the wisdom to act is a serious leadership challenge. Many traditional firms dabble in transformation, set up pilots or demonstration projects, but fail to commit to leading the transformation. Failures arise when managers cannot diagnose the architectural shift or challenge the status quo. Even when they recognize the shift and commit resources, they may face significant headwinds. General Electric's GE Digital unit is an example of a failure due to technology and organizational problems.

The success of enterprise transformation requires ongoing commitment and inspired leadership to build bridges and make necessary changes. Transformation efforts must align the entire organization to capture momentum. The leadership challenge in transformation applies to both traditional and digital firms that must transform repeatedly to survive and build a foundation of safety, security, and sustainability in their business.

Leadership in digital firms should not be limited to the top, as anyone can play a crucial role in shaping the systems. The education, mentoring, and selection of leaders as transformers of new and old companies is important. Managers need to understand the foundational knowledge behind AI and how technology can be effectively deployed in their organization's business and operating models. They should also have a full appreciation of the consequences of getting these systems wrong and understand the softer issues related to the human side of digital operating models. Good leaders of digital firms must understand inspiration, capabilities, and culture needed to drive continued evolution.

Leaders need a well-rounded perspective that includes both technology and understanding human nature of leadership. The emergence of AI presents vast entrepreneurial opportunities, and many challenges also provide opportunities for innovation. Innovation costs have significantly dropped due to digital technology and the availability of open source software and hardware tools. However, a deeper analysis of a venture's business model, including its competitive implications, is often needed to evaluate opportunities.

The text discusses how ride-sharing companies, like Uber, have increased consumer surplus and employment flexibility but may not be profitable and could cause externalities. The author suggests that digital firms need to consider the social and ethical implications of their business models and operating systems. The blockchain space is highlighted as an important solution to problems caused by digitization and AI.

The text highlights that blockchain-based business models need to reflect new thinking to achieve sustainable impact, and that significant business model innovation will drive the success of each blockchain technology. It also emphasizes the need for leaders to deal with continuous change and the importance of entrepreneurship. The text notes that regulation is racing to catch up with the evolution of technology, and that regulators will likely focus on areas such as traffic safety and racial bias as the impact of AI continues to increase.



 Europe introduced GDPR in 2018 to give individuals control over their personal data, but it may disproportionately benefit large tech companies. Antitrust efforts in Europe have targeted companies like Microsoft and Google, but fines may not be the most effective remedy. Crafting appropriate remedies for violations in privacy and antitrust is challenging and requires extensive debate, and hub companies are recognizing the need to work with governments to shape regulations and policy.



 Tech firms are developing capabilities to shape policy outcomes, but collaboration between companies and regulators is needed to tackle difficult challenges such as inequality, privacy, and bias. Collaborative structures and approaches with sustained expert involvement may be the most effective solution. Communities can provide checks and balances to digital firms, and the Linux operating system serves as an example of successful community-driven development. The community was highly structured with clear governance and accountability, and the software was available for free under the GPL.

Open source software allows for product derivatives to be available for free and is motivated by various incentives such as skill development and community building. Linux is the most popular cloud operating system, and open source software powers a variety of popular products. The open source approach has been effective in various industries, including online listings and Wikipedia, which resembles the governance of many open source projects.

Wikipedia has a transparent editing process, and research has shown that bias tends to erode over time through community feedback. Diversity of political views leads to higher quality content, and the open source community can be an asset in solving digital problems. Open source organizations can play a critical role in solving issues such as algorithmic bias and fake news.



 Community collaboration is an effective model for creating, maintaining, and preserving important software products and technologies across industries and organizations. 

 This model has been emulated in content and AI research, and community considerations should influence future regulatory checks and balances on hub firms. 

 Investing in shaping crowds and innovation communities with fair and dynamic governance systems can improve monitoring, response, and long-term improvements. 

 Crowds and communities can dramatically improve and extend the impact of regulatory and policy-making bodies, bringing enforcement and response systems to new levels of response and innovation. 

 The impact of digital transformation has made collective wisdom essential for sustaining performance and safeguarding institutions across industries, countries, markets, and political affiliations.



 The complex interrelationships across communities and organizations have made sudden collective failures a major constraint. 

 The responsibility of leaders in digital firms is immense, particularly with the collective dynamics of AI-enabled social and economic networks. 

 The performance of digital firms increasingly hinges on their impact on the broader community, beyond traditional drivers of managerial effectiveness. 

 Digital firms will be held accountable to a different standard, and consequences on the broader community should be considered in critical business decisions. 

 Managers must embrace the idea of an AI-driven and digitally connected economy and make decisions that go beyond optimizing the single firm to benefit the collective.

The article suggests that individual firms should focus on improving the collective performance of their networks rather than solely focusing on their own success. Establishing common principles and developing open digital technologies can help achieve this. The Partnership on AI is a promising model for research and collaboration. The article recommends a philosophical shift towards considering the collective health of ecosystems when making business decisions, and highlights the new wisdom of leadership in competition. The burden of this responsibility will fall on the small number of firms that serve as network hubs.

The article highlights the crucial role played by digital networks and AI in shaping the economy and society. It emphasizes the need for a new kind of managerial wisdom to navigate through the challenges and opportunities created by these transformative technologies. The article suggests that the frameworks presented in the book will inform debates and generate new thinking among leaders. Tencent and other organizations are credited for their success in creating strong and resilient ecosystems, but the responsibility of leadership in this context is emphasized.

The article includes a list of references and resources related to the role of art in artificial intelligence (AI), discussing topics such as the impact of new technologies on traditional industries, the use of electronic data interchange and radio frequency identification in supply chain management, and the importance of modularity and strategic thinking in the network economy. It also references a quote by Walmart's CEO on the company's digital transformation and a Guardian article on the Digital Rembrandt project.

This text lists several academic articles and books related to platform competition, networked markets, and the impact of technology on the economy. The referenced works cover topics such as two-sided markets, platform leadership, democratizing innovation, and the role of artificial intelligence.

The chapter on Ant Financial heavily relies on a case study by Feng Zhu and Krishna Palepu. Ant Financial raised a significant amount of money in 2018, almost as much as all fintech startups in the US and Europe combined. The company's success can be attributed to its dynamic capabilities and operating model. Ant Financial's history is intertwined with that of Alibaba, and its success is due in part to its focus on cashless transactions and innovative technology.
